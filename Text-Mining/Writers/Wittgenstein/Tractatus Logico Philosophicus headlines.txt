 What is the case a fact is the existence of states of affairs.
 A logical picture of facts is a thought.
 A thought is a proposition with a sense.
 A proposition is a truth function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)
 The general form of a truth function is [p, E, N(E)]. This is the general form of a proposition.
 What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.
