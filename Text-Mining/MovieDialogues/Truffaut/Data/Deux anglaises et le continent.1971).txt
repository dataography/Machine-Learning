1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,700
Last night I relived our story.
Some day I'll write it

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,700
Muriel thinks it might help others

3
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,000
mother...

4
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
well, Claude?

5
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
I was waiting for you

6
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,900
can't you introduce yourself?

7
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Mother's spoken of you

8
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
and of you, too

9
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
do you like Paris?

10
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,500
Yes, I find that...

11
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Paris is...
I like the Parisians

12
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,500
and the English?

13
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
They're less lively,
less open...

14
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,800
but logical and imaginative
in their way

15
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,300
you're not shocked by the french?

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Not shocked, but surprised

17
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,700
they lie more than we do...

18
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
but once you know the odds,
it's fine

19
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
so you've met?

20
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
A pity that Claude...

21
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,300
isn't well enough to show you Paris

22
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,700
but come see us often

23
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
you two should speak English

24
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,400
Claude needs the practice

25
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
she raised her veil. Claude thought
of chaste and pleasing nudity

26
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,600
he noted in his diary...

27
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,000
that she was his age
and seemed sensitive yet sensible

28
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,100
their mothers had been
childhood friends

29
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
Anne visited Claude often

30
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,500
they exchanged books and ideas...

31
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,300
with the ease of old friends

32
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Anne wanted to be a sculptress

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,500
she "discovered" Rodin,
then unknown in England

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Anne spoke of a sister,
Muriel... 2 years younger...

35
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,300
she found a photo of Muriel,
aged ten...

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,600
round face, prim mouth,
clear brow...

37
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,400
and a shy, untamed look

38
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
"come see her," Anne said

39
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,100
"I'd like to hear you two talk"

40
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
you don't need that any more

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,100
give it to me!

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
So Claude went to visit
the browns in Wales

43
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
his mother raised no objections

44
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,100
what's going on?

45
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,500
It's our neighbour, Mr flint...

46
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,900
his boat was stolen today

47
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,000
he refuses to sign a complaint

48
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,200
he says the thief's need is greater

49
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,700
admirable!

50
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,100
A rare attitude around here

51
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,200
I'll show you the house

52
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,200
I share this room with Muriel...

53
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,700
and that's our mother's room

54
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,600
here's your room

55
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,700
very nice

56
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,400
- I'll help you.
- Very pretty

57
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
unpack... you'll meet mother later

58
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
you'll see Muriel tonight

59
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,300
Claude felt Mrs brown's reserve

60
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,000
Anne had talked about him...

61
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,700
but Mrs brown would judge
for herself

62
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,300
Muriel did not join them

63
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
she'd strained her eyes

64
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,300
they ate almost in silence

65
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Claude stared at the empty chair...

66
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,100
Muriel's chair

67
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
the next day they took easels...

68
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,900
and went to the cliff to paint

69
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,700
what a pity Muriel can't be here!

70
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,500
Dinner's ready

71
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm coming

72
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
Muriel's dining with us...

73
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,900
but don't look at her yet

74
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,600
Anne's spoken of you

75
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
and about you, too

76
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,700
good trip?

77
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,100
Fine. I wasn't even seasick

78
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,500
"I wasn't even seasick!"
You sounded like a little boy

79
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,200
as a child, Muriel would come
from the dentist...

80
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,000
and we'd ask if it hurt.
She'd say:

81
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,400
"No, and I didn't even cry"

82
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,100
dear mother...
I finally met Muriel

83
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
she's smaller than Anne,
with red hair

84
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,200
her eyes are bandaged

85
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
she lifts one edge to see her plate

86
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
her voice is low and husky

87
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
it matches her shy, untamed look

88
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,500
her hands are soft to look at

89
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,900
have Anne and Muriel deserted you?

90
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
Anne's working
and Muriel was tired...

91
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,300
so I went for a walk

92
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,700
Claude found a book in his room...

93
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,400
an anonymous gift

94
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
"Eureka" by Edgar Allen Poe

95
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,100
may I see you?

96
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,800
I'll be right there

97
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
I want to talk as we did in Paris

98
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,700
I don't know how to tell you this...

99
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
just say it

100
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
it seems I brought you here
for nothing

101
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
mother's angry with Muriel,
it spoils everything

102
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
I hadn't noticed

103
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,500
Muriel damaged her eyes working
at night for her professor...

104
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
on a book, I think

105
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,400
mother says
she should've asked her...

106
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
that she mustn't hide things

107
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,700
Muriel admits she's at fault...

108
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
but says
you have to take risks in life...

109
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,500
and shouldn't always have
to consult your mother

110
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
the entire household is upset

111
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
and also...

112
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,800
she didn't go on

113
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Claude wanted to take her hand

114
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,900
he imagined
her distant voice saying...

115
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,400
"and also... kiss me"

116
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,300
he tried to erase
this frivolous though

117
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,000
you haven't told me

118
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,700
how do you like Muriel?

119
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,200
I don't know her yet.
When I see her eyes...

120
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,100
when you do,
everything will change

121
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
'who muddies my water,
who makes so bold? '

122
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,300
'Growled the wolf, stern and cold'

123
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,700
'you'll be punished for this feat! '

124
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,000
'Sire' the lamb did bleat...

125
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,400
'I pray your majesty,
scalm your rage'

126
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,800
'consider that I assuage
my thirst... '

127
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
the 3 became inseparable

128
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,300
Claude liked
their lack of vanity...

129
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,100
they never spoke ill of anyone

130
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,800
Muriel now wore dark glasses

131
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,900
her expression was still hidden

132
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,900
she took up tennis again

133
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,800
she was quick and supple

134
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,300
walking home,
Anne went ahead, hips swinging

135
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,800
Mrs brown had made the girls read...

136
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,500
"Les miserables" in English

137
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,800
Anne could quote Verlaine.
Muriel, only the bible

138
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,300
Claude attacked Muriel
on this point. He persisted...

139
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,300
then grew uneasy

140
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
did I shock you?

141
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
On the contrary, I'm grateful

142
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,300
you talk a lot
but we need shaking up

143
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,200
you help me to think

144
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm slow...

145
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
we must go in

146
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,500
dear mother,
I begin to know Muriel

147
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,800
she's not yet
as Anne described her...

148
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
but she's convalescing

149
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,600
my adopted sisters call me
"the continent" which sounds wrong

150
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,700
I prefer their "bonjour la France!"

151
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,600
They played silly games...

152
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,500
Claude always lost

153
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,100
he told them

154
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
that suicide
wasn't a crime in France

155
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,600
"all France would be in jail,
since everyone has tried it"

156
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,500
"even you?"

157
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
"Yes, of course"

158
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,700
he would tell all,
after changing places

159
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,100
I'd rather not be between you

160
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,200
I like to be able to look at you

161
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I was 15 when I decided to die

162
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,800
I locked my bedroom door...

163
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,800
and put an alcohol burner
under my bed

164
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,800
I lit it and then lay down...

165
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,200
calmly

166
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,700
I took a razor...

167
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,900
and carefully slit my wrists

168
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,800
the blood spurted out...

169
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,600
I fainted...

170
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,900
and woke up in my mother's bed

171
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
my wrists were bandaged
and mother sat near me

172
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,400
the doctor was there, very stern

173
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,100
the bed didn't burn well...

174
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,400
and the cook saw smoke coming
from under the door

175
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
your mother?

176
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Never said a word

177
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
good for her

178
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,900
how tall was your building?

179
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Six floors, I think

180
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
nice funeral pyre

181
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,200
you were dying for a dream...

182
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,000
but you could've killed...

183
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,400
children on the floors above

184
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,900
I didn't think

185
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,800
now how do you like Muriel?

186
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,600
She's perfect in her way

187
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
is that all?

188
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,600
So my lightning-bolt didn't strike

189
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,200
I'll have to leave
you two alone more often

190
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
here she is...

191
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,300
they came back...

192
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,400
on foot

193
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,900
they stopped by a river
full of torrents

194
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,300
they decided the tumbling water
was like Anne...

195
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,800
the eddies like Claude,
the peaceful pools like Muriel

196
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,800
he felt at home with them

197
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
he wrote about them in his diary...

198
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
watching them was better

199
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,800
I could go on about them for pages

200
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,400
I'd rather just watch them

201
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,500
little by little...

202
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,500
Muriel starts to be,
as Anne predicted...

203
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
in "first place"

204
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,300
they laughed while Claude watched

205
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,900
Mrs brown was like a ball
being pushed to and fro

206
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
suddenly he was a pawn
in a strange game

207
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
squeezed between the girls...

208
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,500
he didn't dare breathe

209
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,400
he'd never even touched their hands

210
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,900
now their supple backs...

211
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,600
thrust against him

212
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,100
it was like an indiscretion

213
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,300
Mrs brown laughed...
he saw she had once been pretty

214
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,900
"... and they called this game... "

215
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,900
"the citron presse"

216
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,900
"they're superior
to the french girls I know"

217
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,100
"they've become my sisters"

218
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,200
"what are they like?"

219
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
"First... my sister Anne"

220
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,600
"I lend her books I like... "

221
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,000
"she doesn't like them.
We argue... "

222
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,100
"then she laughs and says
she's just an ordinary girl"

223
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,600
"Anne considers Muriel
far above her"

224
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,800
"Muriel's no prettier,
she's different"

225
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,700
"when we climb the cliffs... "

226
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,800
"she's like an Anglo-mountaineer... "

227
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,900
Anglo-mountaineer?

228
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,700
"Swinging her hips vigorously"

229
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,600
"it could seem provocative... "

230
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,700
"but she is so pure"

231
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,800
"Muriel... is purity"

232
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,200
he's in love with her

233
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
in love with whom?

234
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
With Mlle Muriel

235
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,300
in love with Muriel?

236
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,600
Ridiculous! He loves them both

237
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
go on!

238
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,100
Coming?

239
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,400
Not today

240
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,300
- I'd rather not.
- I insist you come!

241
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,400
I insist I stay!

242
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
Have a nice walk

243
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,400
your English won't improve

244
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
you must talk
to other English people

245
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,600
I can only talk to one at a time

246
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,100
once there are two...

247
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,800
they get together and ignore me

248
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,400
I find the English argumentative...

249
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,900
disdainful, insensitive...

250
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
and unimaginative

251
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,100
and you're blunt
and over-confident

252
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
you don't know life

253
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,000
and you do?

254
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,300
For instance love... physical love

255
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,000
the only love is true love

256
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,000
which is physical love

257
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,900
you talk too much

258
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,300
a continental gentleman
would notice...

259
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,500
that his islander audience
was tired

260
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,500
I'm not hungry

261
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,100
she led him along,
as Anne had done

262
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,500
the same situation, a month later

263
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,400
the sisters were so alike,
yet so unlike...

264
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,500
he marveled that they treated him
as a brother

265
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,700
Muriel stayed in her room
for the next 2 days

266
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,900
Claude didn't believe
she was really ill

267
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,500
had he offended her somehow?

268
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,300
He couldn't read,
or think of anything else

269
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,200
he thought of Muriel

270
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,200
I heard you.
You're not sick?

271
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm not sick, I just couldn't sleep

272
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,400
I was thinking of you

273
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
you mustn't think of me

274
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,700
why are you angry with me?
What have I done?

275
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,100
I'm not angry... I'm afraid

276
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
afraid?

277
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Whenever I say I'm afraid...

278
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
you always ask: "of what?"

279
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Maybe "afraid"
has another meaning in french

280
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,800
even when I thought
you were angry...

281
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
I couldn't criticize you...

282
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,700
you must criticize me!

283
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,500
Friends must criticize, not flatter

284
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,300
spoil me
and you'll spoil everything!

285
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,300
Goodnight, Claude

286
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
why do you touch me?

287
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Because you come from the earth...
I like that

288
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,100
we must go to sleep now

289
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,500
we have some questions about...

290
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
you say it, Anne

291
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,400
but I don't know what...

292
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,600
yes, you do, remember?

293
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Of course...

294
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,900
how mysterious!

295
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,100
We're curious about...
scarlet women

296
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
good lord!

297
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,700
Well, I'll do my best to answer you

298
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,300
it's a recognized profession
in France?

299
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
It's under police supervision

300
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,700
the girls are examined monthly

301
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,100
how horrible!

302
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,100
There are special houses...

303
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,000
you mean brothels?

304
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
You know that word?

305
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,700
We had 6 near our military camp

306
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,100
did you go?

307
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I visited the one
considered to be the best

308
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,200
officers, civil servants
and townsmen used it

309
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,100
the stairs were screened
to preserve privacy

310
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
good idea

311
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
inside, it was impeccable...

312
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
the girls modestly dressed

313
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,500
I said I had come to talk

314
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,000
an attractive woman said...

315
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,300
"fine, I'll call madame"

316
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,500
the woman in charge

317
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,400
a plump, respectable-looking
brunette

318
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,900
she had an anisette with me

319
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,900
I praised her well-run house

320
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,800
she thanked me

321
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,300
I got her going on her work

322
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,700
she felt part of the community...

323
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,200
as much as the mayor
or the colonel...

324
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,300
both of whom were customers

325
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,100
"we contribute to public health... "

326
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,000
"and family well-being"

327
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,800
"I don't allow disease or scandal"

328
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,700
a conscientious woman

329
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,300
she thought
she played a useful role?

330
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Absolutely

331
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
incredible!

332
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,100
But who are we to condemn her?

333
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,700
One day maybe you can take us

334
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
we want to see for ourselves

335
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,800
take you? Yes, maybe

336
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,100
why not, in fact?

337
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,100
Our education glosses over
certain essentials

338
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800
for example...

339
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,500
I didn't understand "virgin"
until I read germinal

340
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,800
do you agree?

341
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
To choose between 2 things,
you must know both

342
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,700
I can't choose vice or virtue...

343
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,900
knowing only virtue

344
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,400
Anne thanked him...

345
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,400
"you shake us out
of our complacency"

346
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,400
they bicycled back home

347
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,900
Claude liked the back
of Muriel's neck...

348
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
he could stare at it unseen

349
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,900
mother wants you

350
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,800
after dinner?

351
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
You'd better go now

352
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,000
I have two things to say...

353
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,300
the first is this...

354
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,500
I admire your mother

355
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,900
she's my friend,
she has great character

356
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,200
having lost her husband
even younger than I did...

357
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
she never remarried
despite many chances

358
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
the second thing is...

359
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,000
I've heard about a conversation
here late at night

360
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,000
luckily it's thought Anne was there

361
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,700
Anne tells me she was not there

362
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,700
I trust my girls
and I know you're a gentleman

363
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,100
they have advanced ideas
that I don't share

364
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
the ideas have grown
since you came

365
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,500
they've explained them

366
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,600
though I've tried, I can't approve

367
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,700
these ideas lead
to a freedom of behavior...

368
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,200
which has aroused comment

369
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,200
from a purely practical
standpoint...

370
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,500
a girl must do nothing
to arouse comment

371
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,900
her reputation will suffer

372
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,600
I asked Anne
how she stood with you

373
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,500
had there been any hint...

374
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,300
of an inclination...

375
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
or intentions? She said no...

376
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,100
and I believe her

377
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,100
I asked her about you and Muriel.
She gave the same answer

378
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,200
she finally said...

379
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,800
"I think Muriel and Claude... "

380
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,800
"have some feeling
for each other... "

381
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
"but they don't know it yet"

382
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,600
in my day we knew those things

383
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,400
therefore I must ask you...

384
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,900
no... come with me

385
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,200
I must ask you to stay
with our friend, Mr flint

386
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
that's his house there

387
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
I also want to say this...

388
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,100
if Anne's prediction comes true...

389
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,000
if one day
a stronger feeling grows...

390
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,700
between you and Muriel...

391
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,600
and you both
deign to recognize it...

392
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,800
I'll not be against it,
personally...

393
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,200
though I have my doubts
about international marriages

394
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,600
in Claude's confusion,
one thought stood out...

395
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,600
Muriel might yet
fall in love with him

396
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,800
Eros took possession
of Claude's heart

397
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,200
he was too busy dreaming of her...

398
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,100
to mope over not seeing her

399
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,600
he now had one goal: Muriel

400
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,500
in his room at Mr flint's...

401
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,300
Claude couldn't sleep

402
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
he thought:
Anne has pledged me to Muriel

403
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,900
there must be a reason.
This love isn't hopeless, after all

404
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,000
I loved Muriel but I wavered...

405
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
thinking she couldn't love me

406
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,100
what Mrs brown had done...

407
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,800
was to open a door for Claude.
He must rush in...

408
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,900
risking all for Muriel

409
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Muriel, your stern face...

410
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,300
so relaxed when you smile,
is engraved in my heart

411
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,600
each day is a milestone

412
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
I see you in our home
with our child

413
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,700
this image absorbs me

414
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,500
I must earn a living

415
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,000
that takes precedence over
the books I want to write

416
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,500
Mr flint's company needs a man...

417
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,100
to handle french correspondance

418
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
I'll apply.
I'll adopt your country...

419
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,500
I love you, I want you for my wife

420
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
a letter for you

421
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,900
Muriel's answer?

422
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm afraid to open it

423
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,100
you know what it says?

424
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,900
Claude, you don't know me.
I'm a simple girl

425
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,300
my family is enough for me

426
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,400
don't be hurt. Tell yourself...

427
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,800
"she doesn't love me, nor I her"

428
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
"we're brother and sister"

429
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,900
I'll never be your wife

430
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,100
poor Claude

431
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,000
it's my fault

432
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,700
I started all this

433
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,800
you're not to blame.
Anyway, I must leave

434
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,300
I don't believe
everything Muriel says

435
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't want to give you
false hope...

436
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,900
but maybe she doesn't know
her own mind

437
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,300
I admire her letter

438
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,100
I aimed too high

439
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,400
I must lower my sights...

440
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
and destroy this love

441
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,600
you're wrong

442
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,200
if I were you,
I wouldn't destroy my love

443
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Muriel can change... yes

444
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,500
come see us tomorrow

445
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,900
no, I won't come

446
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,900
you'll come

447
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,200
Claude, I adore you...

448
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Claude, I want
to be honest with you

449
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
when you asked me to marry you...

450
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,300
I found it incredible

451
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,900
I replied: "no, never"

452
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,500
is that "never"
engraved in your heart?

453
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,200
I must keep you informed, right?

454
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
I still say "no"...

455
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,000
but I withdraw the "never"

456
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm like a river
that rises and falls

457
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,600
that's why I can't answer you now

458
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,500
then there's hope?

459
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,400
A beginning of hope

460
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,300
good...

461
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,700
may I tell my mother?

462
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,400
Yes, if you feel the need

463
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,100
no, Claude, don't say any more...

464
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,200
don't add anything

465
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,000
mother, I love Muriel

466
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,900
I waited to tell you
until there was hope

467
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,200
I think you'll be pleased.
Muriel resembles you

468
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,100
Mrs brown distrusts
such marriages...

469
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,700
but leaves Muriel free

470
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,500
we await your arrival

471
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,800
it all happened so suddenly

472
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,200
I'm not afraid of losing you,
I'm worried about you

473
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,000
how will you live...

474
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
and on what?

475
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,000
Like you,
Muriel wants me to write

476
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,900
but I prefer
a steady job, perhaps...

477
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,200
with Mr flint

478
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,100
you're not well yet

479
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm sure Muriel
has many good qualities

480
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:52,100
but for 3 years she has had to care
for her eyes... you told me so!

481
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,900
You were pushed into it

482
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,000
you wouldn't have thought of it

483
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,200
when your father died,
I raised you

484
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,900
my monument... I raised you
stone by stone

485
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,000
Claude's mother was firm.
She'd never felt physical love

486
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,500
to Claude,
this explained her hostility

487
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
hoping to reconcile
the irreconcilable

488
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,300
Mr flint was asked to arbitrate

489
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,100
we're here to discuss a marriage

490
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,800
I have heard...

491
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,800
the pros and cons

492
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,500
the girl's mother...

493
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,000
asks that the matter...

494
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,600
be decided quickly...

495
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,400
one way or another

496
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,800
the young man's mother...

497
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,900
thinks their state of health...

498
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,900
makes the marriage impossible

499
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,300
after reflection...

500
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I propose the following

501
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,300
out of respect for their mothers...

502
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,800
Muriel and Claude will separate
for a year

503
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,200
during that year
they'll take care of themselves...

504
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,200
conscientiously

505
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,500
they'll neither see
nor write each other

506
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,500
what we ask of them is a sacrifice

507
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,600
but if, after a year...

508
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,100
they wish to marry...

509
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,200
or resume their friendship...

510
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,300
neither mother...

511
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,000
not Claude's...

512
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,100
nor Muriel's,
will stand in their way

513
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,200
Claude's mother knew
a lot could happen in a year

514
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,400
the youngsters found it inhuman...

515
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,400
they longed to be together

516
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,400
it won't be difficult,
if we're brave

517
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,600
Claude, look at me

518
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,300
I have an idea

519
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,400
let's both keep diaries
to send each other

520
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,000
what if one of us had died...

521
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,600
god be with us!

522
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,300
I just took communion for Claude

523
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,500
I don't know what it means,
but it was for him

524
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,800
if I wanted to get pregnant,
I wouldn't know how

525
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,100
if Claude still loves me
in a year...

526
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,700
I'll say to him...

527
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,700
"I'm yours,
do with me as you will"

528
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,800
if he were a pirate
and abducted me...

529
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,800
I'd go willingly

530
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,000
Claude thought: My last summer
with mother before I marry Muriel

531
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,800
he was overly attentive
playing the role of "good son"

532
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,600
like David Copperfield,
he'd never known his father

533
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
his mother told him...

534
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,200
of their courtship

535
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
his mother died

536
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,100
the day after the funeral...

537
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,000
he asked my mother for my hand

538
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,700
then he came to me

539
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,500
I said: "wasn't it arranged?"

540
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,600
He said: "that's true"

541
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,800
he courted me, not with flowers
but with beautiful books

542
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,800
we married very quickly

543
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,300
he was 31 and I was 23

544
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,600
we lived
near the Luxembourg gardens

545
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,000
then I was expecting you

546
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,900
Sundays, tired by my pregnancy...

547
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
I wanted to sit in the park

548
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,600
Pierre would say:

549
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,300
"Let's visit the Louvre
so our son will love art"

550
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
we'd hire a carriage and go

551
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,100
a collector had asked Claude...

552
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,300
to select some paintings for him

553
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,200
a modern art exhibit
was opening in London

554
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,200
he resolved to go
without his mother

555
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,700
she was worried about him
seeing Muriel

556
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,700
you won't try to see her?

557
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,700
No, mother, a promise is a promise

558
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,900
Muriel! Come back...

559
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,200
Claude, I was told
you were in England

560
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,900
were you in our town?

561
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,900
On our street?

562
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm afraid to meet you...

563
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,200
yet my eyes seek you

564
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,800
my friend Claude, do I love you?

565
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,500
Not at all!

566
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,100
If we met, I would say...

567
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,200
"you're no husband for me"

568
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
you've never courted me

569
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,400
you forced me
to fall in love with you

570
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,100
that's all... goodbye, Claude

571
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,100
I don't love you

572
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,900
on his return, his mother said...

573
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,400
he should manage their property

574
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,400
he took charge of the 3 buildings
inherited from his father

575
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,600
a nice view...

576
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,600
yes. It's a bit dirty...
but it could be fixed up

577
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,700
it'd be a charming place

578
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,500
perfect for a bachelor

579
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,200
in one of the buildings
a garret flat was free

580
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,100
he decided to move in

581
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,500
an article about women painters
brought Claude a thank-you note

582
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:37,000
he visited the sender.
Her studio was unusual

583
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,700
you know we almost met before...

584
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
at Massoulier's on Friday

585
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
yes, I was there

586
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,100
I came at midnight.
You'd just left...

587
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,700
like Cinderella

588
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,200
doesn't that bowl you over?

589
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,900
Pretty, aren't they?

590
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,300
Want to see all of me?

591
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,700
It's very...

592
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,000
no compliments are necessary

593
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,000
come, I've work to do

594
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,000
we could meet somewhere
quieter sometime

595
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,600
fine... gladly

596
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,500
why not tonight?

597
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,500
Tonight? Yes

598
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,700
why put off today's follies
until tomorrow

599
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,600
see you tonight

600
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,900
as you were before, girls

601
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,900
don't forget to raise your head

602
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,800
that way, your hat...

603
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,100
perfect... you're lovely

604
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,700
this is Monique de Monferrand

605
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,900
my mother...

606
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,000
see you on Friday?

607
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,200
No! Georges will be back...
I'll write

608
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,900
let's hear your criticism

609
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,400
no criticism... on the contrary

610
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,800
I'm surprised
the place can look so good

611
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,500
lovely...

612
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,100
quite lovely

613
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,200
you're writing to Muriel?

614
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,300
Yes and no...

615
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
that is...

616
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
here, read it

617
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,400
you win...
it only took 6 months

618
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,000
go on, read it

619
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,100
"dear Muriel...
I must live my life... alone

620
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,900
"I won't get to England
for a while

621
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,500
"I'll travel in Europe,
see painters...

622
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,400
"write about them,
do translations

623
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,000
"I must live without wife or child

624
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,800
"this should relieve you

625
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,700
"I have women friends...

626
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,900
"but I shall not marry

627
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,600
"I can live without my sisters but
they won't be forgotten or replaced

628
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,000
"we'll write each other
sometimes...

629
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,900
"but for your sake,
we must say farewell

630
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,500
"your brother, Claude"

631
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,200
but don't ask me
to be your sister!

632
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,300
"Women friends...!"

633
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,900
Dear Claude...

634
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,400
your answer is no, mine is yes

635
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,600
we change places,
as in musical chairs

636
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,100
you no longer want me to love you

637
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,700
if you came, you'd see
how much I'd love you

638
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,000
so would Anne and mother

639
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,700
they would try to influence you

640
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,100
if you came,
my love would reawaken yours

641
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,600
you mustn't come

642
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,800
had you opened your arms...

643
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,500
as one day you will to another...

644
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,200
I would have run to you, trembling

645
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,900
it is not to be

646
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,400
never think that you have hurt me

647
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,800
it is enough that once you loved me

648
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,300
I collapsed on my bed,
crying and calling you

649
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,700
she didn't send it
nor the others she wrote later

650
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,200
did he suffer
when he destroyed our love?

651
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,300
Do men often lead women
to want them...

652
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,600
then say "no, thank you"?

653
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,500
"I am your sister"

654
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,400
I still have prayer

655
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,700
Claude, I pray for your purity

656
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,700
your ideas about women
will change

657
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,000
if you love another,
it will be all right

658
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
love doesn't complicate life...

659
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,000
but the uncertainty of love

660
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,700
I am without hope

661
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,200
I only know I must hold on...
it's vital

662
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,900
I must hold on!

663
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,100
Life is made up of pieces
that don't fit

664
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,500
I want all of Claude, or nothing

665
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,100
if it's no... let it be like death

666
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,200
it's Muriel's answer

667
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,800
read it... I want your opinion

668
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,300
"dear Claude,
I'm glad you wrote me...

669
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,000
"thus ending a misunderstanding
and a false situation

670
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,500
"it's best to renounce
the marriage immediately

671
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,800
"Anne and I will always be
your friends

672
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,500
"the garden is superb

673
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,700
"we're going to London
to see the new plays

674
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,900
"regards from my mother.
Your sister, Muriel"

675
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,800
an excellent letter

676
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,300
I knew she was a sensible girl

677
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
are you reassured? Happy?

678
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,300
You're not happy?

679
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,600
Yes...

680
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,900
you took this on deposit?

681
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,300
The two of them

682
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,500
but this one's going back
to the gallery

683
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,900
time passed...

684
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,300
Claude had not become
an author...

685
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,400
but he wrote articles about art

686
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,900
his mother condoned his affairs...

687
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,100
many women were less
threatening than one

688
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,900
he forgot his "sisters"

689
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,100
in Wales, Muriel slowly recovered

690
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,400
at times she went to bed saying...

691
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,000
"today I didn't think about Claude"

692
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,600
did you know Anne brown
was in Paris?

693
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,900
Her mother wrote me

694
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,200
you didn't tell me

695
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,700
it was part of our agreement

696
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,500
but it's Anne... not Muriel

697
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,300
it's the same thing

698
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,000
I'll write her a note

699
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,700
instead of writing,
go talk to her

700
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,700
what about you?

701
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,400
I'll go exchange these books

702
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,300
I'll see you tomorrow

703
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,100
you're not angry?

704
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,900
No, I'm not

705
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,400
till tomorrow

706
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,700
been back in Paris long?

707
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,000
Since January

708
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,100
that's when I arrived!

709
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,300
How about me? Have I changed?

710
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,900
You seem serious,
but you look fine

711
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,300
don't you want news of someone?

712
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,400
Yes... how is she?

713
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,900
She's been sick... her eyes

714
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,300
but she's suffered more
from other things

715
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,400
I understand

716
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,800
and now?

717
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,700
She's better.
She works with children

718
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,100
she teaches Sunday school

719
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,400
actually, I can't tell you
much about her

720
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,400
she no longer confides in me
and I'm sorry

721
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,400
two words are never spoken
in our house...

722
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,100
the words "Claude" and "Paris"

723
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,900
Anne was becoming a sculptress

724
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,700
she had a studio in Paris

725
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,300
she now felt sure
Muriel and Claude...

726
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,500
would never get together.
Yet they'd come so close

727
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,600
no longer in Muriel's shadow...

728
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,100
Anne was the girl
that he'd first met

729
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,300
she was there for herself
and he liked that

730
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,200
they often went to look...

731
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,100
at Rodin's "Balzac",
done on commission...

732
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,600
then indignantly refused

733
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,600
Claude often went to Anne's studio

734
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,700
he encouraged her...

735
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,400
gave her confidence in her work

736
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Claude found Anne especially
pretty today...

737
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,500
he sensed her heart beating like his

738
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,400
Muriel was no longer a barrier

739
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,800
he had a mad idea:
Caress her breast

740
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,500
why not try?

741
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Would she be shocked,
or slap him?

742
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,300
No, Claude, wait...

743
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,900
listen to me

744
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,000
she moved away from him
to explain...

745
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,900
someone had always
overshadowed her...

746
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,800
dazzled her, silenced her.
It was Muriel

747
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,200
Anne had introduced Claude
to Muriel...

748
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,200
for pleasure,
to see them match wits

749
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,000
picturing them married,
she'd stepped aside

750
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,300
virtuous? No... realistic

751
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,300
were you jealous of her?

752
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Sometimes... but not for long

753
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,900
when you played tennis together...

754
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,700
you were a real couple

755
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,300
and we failed

756
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,100
no man had touched Anne...
she'd be his

757
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,500
he'd be the first...
but not here, not in Paris

758
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,800
they'd go away

759
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,100
Claude borrowed an island cabin
on a Swiss lake

760
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,900
they'd go there for a week.
They'd try... draw closer

761
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,500
they were more resolute
than in love

762
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,800
tomorrow we must buy matches

763
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,600
a hot meal would be nice

764
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,500
wait... just for a moment

765
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,100
the 1st night, Anne pulled away

766
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,600
she put up a blanket as a curtain

767
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,400
Claude was to undress
on his own side

768
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,500
the island is pretty, isn't it?

769
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,400
I'm sure the old lady would sell it

770
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,700
I wonder how much she'd want

771
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,000
are you in bed?

772
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,900
May I come?

773
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,500
You're not answering

774
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,500
are you asleep?

775
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,300
It's very nice

776
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,000
tell me, Anne...

777
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,200
haven't you ever wanted a man?

778
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,700
There was one last summer...
much too handsome

779
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,200
his face was too symmetrical

780
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,400
I dreamed about him

781
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,000
I dreamed he kissed me there

782
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,000
I knew it, I was sure!

783
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,100
You have great curiosity
about men...

784
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,400
almost a divine curiosity

785
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,800
it will lead you
to have many lovers

786
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,900
think so?

787
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,100
I don't know

788
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,500
I only care about my work

789
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,500
I'll make statues, not babies

790
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,800
the 2nd night: More kisses

791
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
is the word "copain"
vulgar in french?

792
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,000
No, just colloquial

793
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,400
it means "friend"...
but warmer and more intimate

794
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,900
I'm your "copain" then?

795
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,400
Sometimes,
but we're more than that

796
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:57,600
"copains" don't kiss on the lips
with hearts racing

797
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,200
I'm tired of being a virgin,
but I'm afraid

798
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,500
afraid?

799
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,800
If you're afraid, we'll wait

800
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,900
you're not angry?

801
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,700
I'm glad we have time

802
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,700
nothing to say?

803
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,200
I'm listening to you...

804
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,000
watching you

805
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,500
I'm glad you're here

806
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,200
the 3rd night,
Anne seemed very busy

807
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,500
what are you doing?

808
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,300
I've decided

809
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,300
no curtain tonight

810
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,100
no blouse

811
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,000
no skirt

812
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,800
Anne... what is that?

813
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,800
Her underclothes were impossible.
Fashioned with a knife...

814
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
red flannel, military-looking

815
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,800
she removed them simply
and came to him nude

816
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,500
now, Claude

817
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,800
I'm ready now

818
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,700
are you sure?

819
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,200
I'm sure

820
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,100
not afraid any more?

821
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,200
It had to be...

822
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,100
I'm happy

823
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,000
because you wanted to...

824
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,400
but it's not yet... us

825
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,800
it was as if you were alone

826
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,600
the week ended.
Claude wanted to stay on

827
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,800
Anne refused saying:
"Now I see life differently"

828
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,400
"I can learn the rest alone
but I've only you, for love"

829
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,100
she was going home to England,
Claude to Paris, alone

830
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,700
Anne gave him one last nod
of farewell

831
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,900
they were free and it was good

832
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,800
monsieur Claude, your mail

833
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,100
thank you...

834
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,700
are you staying here now?

835
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,200
For a while

836
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,500
dear Claude,
I came home yesterday

837
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,300
this is some wallpaper
from our room

838
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,400
mother and Muriel are in bed

839
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,900
I cried

840
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,200
you're more real than my sculpture

841
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,500
I felt you kissing me yesterday...

842
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,400
Wednesday afternoon at 4

843
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,400
were you thinking of me then?

844
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,700
When I look in the mirror
I wish I'd given you more

845
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,500
Muriel knows I see you, that's all

846
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,900
I know you have other women
but I'm not jealous

847
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,100
3 months later,
Anne was back in Paris

848
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,300
on the stairs
he already wanted her profoundly

849
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,500
she'd changed... the "half-tomboy"
aspect was gone

850
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,300
she was a woman...

851
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,000
have you had breakfast?

852
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,600
No, I thought
I'd have it with you

853
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,800
but I've nothing here

854
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,400
their eyes met...
hers were now daring

855
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,900
their love-making was new
for them both

856
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,000
Anne now knew
how to use her body

857
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,000
how strange!

858
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,900
What?

859
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,100
To love someone so much

860
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,200
he realized it was 3 years ago
that he had first desired her

861
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,800
you're my breakfast

862
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,000
Claude... I'm too happy

863
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,200
I should have other lovers

864
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,500
I'll let you do the same

865
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,300
love me as much as you can

866
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,200
happiness can't be told,
but it wears down... unnoticed

867
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,300
in public,
Claude rediscovered Anne

868
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,900
she dressed better... smarter

869
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:00,300
they'd just made love,
yet she looked so virginal

870
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,500
Anne accepted Claude's ideas
on free love

871
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,600
he could have other affairs,
but she refused...

872
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,800
rejecting all offers

873
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,300
Diurka, a brawny Slav, spotted Anne.
He published...

874
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,800
art books.
Handsome in a way...

875
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,700
he had youthful eyes.
He liked her, he wanted her

876
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,200
Claude thought...

877
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,300
"if she likes him... she's free"

878
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,600
Claude saw what Anne meant
when she'd said...

879
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,100
"I'm always a success just after... "

880
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,100
Claude let the day go by,
the night...

881
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,700
next morning...

882
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,200
Claude, I must talk to you

883
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,600
come with me...

884
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,300
I'm listening

885
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,700
you already know

886
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,800
Diurka

887
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,500
he was here... when I knocked

888
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,500
do you love him?

889
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,000
I don't know yet

890
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,100
does he love you?

891
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,200
He came to see me.
He looked at my work...

892
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,200
made perceptive comments

893
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,300
he didn't leave

894
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,600
since this morning, we...

895
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,400
does it bother you?

896
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,400
Are you hurt?

897
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,200
I thought you...

898
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,400
true, but it's still a shock

899
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,000
anyway, I approve...
you're right

900
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:02,900
Diurka says
he's been alone for a year

901
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,300
I didn't want to,
I don't love him yet

902
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,500
then he wanted to...

903
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,100
Diurka's a fine person...

904
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,900
you think so, too?

905
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,800
He wants to take me to Persia
with him

906
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,600
I think I'll say No

907
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,900
Persia is magnificent

908
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,400
Anne, only your desires matter

909
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,500
you just met Diurka, go with him

910
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,400
I think you two need time alone

911
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,500
I shouldn't see you...

912
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,000
yes, you should!

913
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,500
So Anne had two regular lovers

914
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,400
they both knew,
Anne didn't hide it

915
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,200
the lovers suffered...
Anne thrived

916
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,100
before Persia,
their farewell lasted all night

917
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,900
dear Claude, you'd love Persia...

918
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,400
you were my life

919
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,500
I only missed you in one way,
I won't say which

920
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,700
your letter said...

921
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:25,100
"don't be afraid to love. "
I obeyed

922
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,600
my uncle used to tell my aunt not to
fear being seasick... she often was

923
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,200
I'm home with Muriel

924
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,000
I'll be in Paris in 3 months...
Anne

925
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,300
Claude recognized Muriel's writing

926
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,200
he was afraid
she'd returned his letter

927
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,100
instead it was part of her diary...

928
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,600
probably
the most intimate confession...

929
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,600
that he would ever read

930
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,700
dear Claude,
we'll never meet again...

931
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,500
and surely that's best

932
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,600
but you mustn't believe I'm pure

933
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,400
I've something terrible to tell you

934
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,300
read my confession...
you'll see that we're even

935
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,600
I've learned from a leaflet...

936
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,700
that since childhood
I've had "nasty habits"

937
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,200
I've weakened my body and brain.
I've abused myself

938
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:52,400
now I know that I'm no longer
a pure woman

939
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,900
it's my duty to confess this to you

940
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,100
no shame will stop me,
I am what I am

941
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,900
if you thought of me as unsullied,
you were wrong

942
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,700
I was eight. A girl, Clarisse...

943
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,900
was first in class. I was second

944
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:11,300
she looked like a mischievous angel.
I was told to be like her

945
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,900
her family spent a week with us

946
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,800
Clarisse slept with me...

947
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
in place of Anne, who was away

948
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,000
in bed, she stripped...

949
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,500
and said I should, too

950
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,500
then she embraced me

951
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,100
I was devoted to her

952
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,500
two little girls
caressed all night...

953
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,500
one knowing, one docile

954
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,500
she taught me to touch
certain parts of my body...

955
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,200
one especially.
She convinced me...

956
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,900
not to talk about our secret

957
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:47,300
after she left
I sometimes did it alone

958
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,500
I didn't understand that part of me

959
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,000
I only knew it was private
and mustn't be seen

960
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
it wasn't to be mentioned

961
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,000
the habit would leave me alone...
then come back

962
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,400
I'd give into it... angry...
unable to stop

963
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,300
one sultry Sunday
when I was 17...

964
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:10,100
I was lying in a field
gazing at the sky

965
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,300
I gave in again...

966
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,300
driven by an unknown force

967
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,400
sometimes I thought of it...

968
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,900
as a way to get to sleep
and to warm my cold feet

969
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,500
but I hated being a slave to it

970
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,400
I fought it, twisting my hands...

971
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,900
face buried, pleading with god

972
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,200
if I couldn't go to sleep...

973
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,100
or think of something else...

974
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,300
I gave in,
then forbade myself to pray

975
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,800
here's a copy of a letter
from America

976
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,000
it has helped me

977
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,800
"my dear young friend...

978
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,300
"your appeal aroused my sympathy

979
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:48,000
"understand your plight
and feel no repugnance

980
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,700
"I admire your frankness

981
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,800
"if you give way, tell yourself...

982
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,700
"that it wasn't you

983
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,400
"you despise this act

984
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,700
"then jump out of bed...

985
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
"and take a cold bath

986
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,800
"don't waste time in self-reproach

987
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,800
"lead an active life, help others

988
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,100
"you learned this habit
despite yourself. It will cease

989
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,300
"best wishes... "

990
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,000
Muriel's confession aroused
more curiosity than emotion

991
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,800
Claude thought...

992
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,500
it was marketable.
He wanted to publish it...

993
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,500
anonymously, in a limited edition

994
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,700
Muriel refused,
not saying how he'd hurt her

995
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,500
"I've abused myself

996
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,300
"now I know that...

997
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,400
"I'm no longer a pure woman

998
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,800
"it's my duty
to confess this to you

999
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,300
"no shame will stop me

1000
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,300
"I am what I am

1001
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,800
"if you thought of me
as unsullied...

1002
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,300
"now you know you were wrong"

1003
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,200
it's all that's left?

1004
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,500
Your properties cost more
than they bring in

1005
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:27,000
repairs
on the rue de Bagnolet place...

1006
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:31,000
wipe out the income
from the others

1007
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,300
what do you advise?

1008
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,800
Sell that one...

1009
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,100
and keep the two others

1010
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,900
I may have a buyer

1011
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,300
I must ask my mother

1012
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,000
go ahead... but quickly

1013
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,300
buyers don't grow on trees

1014
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,200
I'll wait...

1015
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,200
I'm sorry to tire you, mother

1016
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,900
it's dark in here...
light the gas

1017
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,300
the lawyer says
to sell rue de Bagnolet

1018
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,800
what do you think?

1019
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Whatever you do will be right

1020
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:14,000
Claude was alone. He had lost
the most demanding of all his women

1021
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:16,700
he was free to live his own life

1022
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,800
how would he use his freedom?

1023
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,700
Anne came back...

1024
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,100
more mature... prettier.

1025
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,500
Their love-making was restrained

1026
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:27,100
don't look at me

1027
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,500
what's this new modesty?

1028
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:31,800
I've seen you naked so often

1029
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,300
I'll turn around...

1030
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,400
but remember Eurydice!

1031
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,100
If our eyes meet, you'll die

1032
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,200
what did you say?

1033
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,600
Eurydice, the wife of Orpheus

1034
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,900
Anne was meant
to love only one man

1035
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,900
but if that man wasn't Claude...

1036
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,200
she'd go against her instinct

1037
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,700
I haven't been honest

1038
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,400
there's something
I haven't told you

1039
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,900
I didn't come to Paris alone

1040
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,200
Diurka?

1041
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,900
No, Diurka was Persia

1042
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,800
that's finished

1043
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,900
I brought Muriel with me

1044
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,900
she's in Paris.
Do you want to see her?

1045
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,600
I don't know...

1046
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,700
I want to see her if she wants it

1047
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,600
she wants it

1048
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,700
she's afraid
she means nothing to you

1049
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,300
she wants to see you
before leaving

1050
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,300
does she know about us?

1051
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,700
No, nothing at all

1052
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,800
but she must be told

1053
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,800
you're right... but not yet

1054
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,800
no, not yet...

1055
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,700
but it must be done

1056
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,800
she'll be at my studio tonight...

1057
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,500
4 years? Only yesterday!

1058
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:54,100
Muriel held her hand out stiffly
as she had the first time they met

1059
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,600
she could only remove her glasses...

1060
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,100
once the curtains cut off the light

1061
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,600
I've heard nothing from you in ages

1062
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,700
nothing that counts

1063
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:40,400
you didn't write, either

1064
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,800
I couldn't

1065
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,300
after you left, I lost
the normal use of my eyes

1066
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,400
Anne was away

1067
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,200
my left eye gave out first
and I nearly lost them both

1068
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,500
I spent 3 months in total darkness

1069
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,900
at that time I thanked god

1070
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,600
for not giving you a blind wife

1071
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,000
and now?

1072
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,100
I'm getting better

1073
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,100
I came here...

1074
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,700
I was afraid, but I wanted to

1075
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,500
Muriel's virtue frightened Claude

1076
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,500
he thought of her
as unapproachable

1077
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,100
he couldn't touch her
as he had Anne

1078
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,300
he felt insincere,
yet he was deeply moved

1079
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,600
the surprise came from Muriel

1080
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,000
I loved you so much

1081
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,200
I lived for you, Muriel

1082
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,400
I knew joy and pain...

1083
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,500
you're leaving?

1084
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,700
You won't stay with me?

1085
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,800
I can't...

1086
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,300
I wanted to see you again, but...

1087
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,900
I didn't expect to be so... affected

1088
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,000
I don't know what I think...
or want

1089
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,000
- I'll see you again.
- Are you sure?

1090
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,300
I must leave now...

1091
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,100
I must leave, Muriel!

1092
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,700
I found you at last

1093
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,400
here's a letter from Muriel

1094
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,100
I know she's still in love with you

1095
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,200
she says she loves me...

1096
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,100
she wants to go away with me

1097
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,000
you must accept
I know you love her, too

1098
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,100
yes, I love her...

1099
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,500
as much as I did before

1100
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,000
you must talk to her first

1101
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,200
you must tell her everything

1102
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,100
yes

1103
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,600
again Muriel had revealed...

1104
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,000
the violence
of her suppressed love

1105
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,900
Anne took her home
like an invalid

1106
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,800
Muriel wrote Claude
a farewell letter

1107
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:42,000
Anne told me everything,
she wasn't afraid to hurt me

1108
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,800
I was horrified... now I'm calm

1109
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,800
I know Anne loves you
and always will

1110
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,400
she loved you first...

1111
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,800
but silently renounced you
for my sake

1112
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,900
my selfishness made me blind

1113
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,400
she brought you to me...
almost had us engaged

1114
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,100
if a woman like Anne or me
gives herself, she's married

1115
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:05,700
do you want two wives
who are sisters?

1116
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:09,500
Anne and I love the same man.
It's tragic but not unusual

1117
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,200
I'll probably
always think about you

1118
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:15,100
but part of me
has withdrawn from you

1119
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,900
I leave for England in an hour

1120
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:20,400
forgive me for our kiss

1121
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,200
for the first time,
Claude suffered...

1122
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,100
as he had made
so many others suffer

1123
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:29,900
he was sunk in despair

1124
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,400
locked in darkness for days...

1125
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,700
he questioned his very identity

1126
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,700
waiting for sleep, he'd repeat...

1127
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,900
"I am nothing...
I understand nothing"

1128
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,800
slowly he healed himself...

1129
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,300
by writing a book.
"Jerome and Julien"...

1130
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,300
was about a woman
who loved two men

1131
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:54,600
it was his story, transposed
his love for the two sisters

1132
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:22,400
by chance,
Diurka published the book

1133
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:26,300
Claude was cool to him, at first.
Then he got to know and like him

1134
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,300
how do you feel about it?

1135
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,600
Mostly relieved

1136
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:34,000
writing it, I was unhappy

1137
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,400
I was miserable, because...

1138
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,900
it stirred up memories.
Now I feel better...

1139
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,200
as if the characters
had suffered for me

1140
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,600
I understand

1141
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,200
I liked your book very much

1142
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,200
it stirred up memories for me, too

1143
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,800
now I can tell you...
I didn't like you

1144
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,000
you got on my nerves, too

1145
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,600
Anne had only praise for you

1146
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,500
that didn't help any!

1147
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,800
Have you seen her?

1148
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,900
I wanted to...

1149
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:15,400
I heard she was engaged
to a mountain-climber

1150
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,000
she must be married now

1151
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,700
no... she broke her engagement

1152
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,500
why?

1153
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:28,000
I only know it's off,
I don't know why

1154
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,100
still think about her?

1155
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,800
Love stories
should be complete...

1156
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,300
with a beginning,
middle and end

1157
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,200
so our affair with Anne
is probably over

1158
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,900
still, I wonder
why she didn't marry him

1159
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,400
I know a good way to find out

1160
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,300
go and ask her

1161
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:07,700
filled with hope,
Diurka went to Wales

1162
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:10,100
after Persia, he'd let Anne go

1163
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,100
he'd been unable to show his love

1164
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:15,500
now he'd convince her
they could start again

1165
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,500
he'd persuade her
to come away with him

1166
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,000
he'd ask Mrs brown
for Anne's hand

1167
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,500
you remember me?

1168
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,800
I came to see Anne

1169
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,500
then you accept?

1170
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,300
I have your word?

1171
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:17,400
May I get Muriel?

1172
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,900
I spoke to her.
She accepts now

1173
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,500
thank you!

1174
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:06,800
That was why
she broke her engagement

1175
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
she knew she had tuberculosis

1176
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,400
she was superb...
she never told her fiance

1177
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,700
she let him think
she'd changed her mind...

1178
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,800
that she was capricious

1179
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,300
I arrived on a Sunday

1180
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,800
Muriel was teaching in the garden

1181
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,200
she explained everything

1182
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,700
I saw Anne right away...

1183
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,500
I persuaded her to see a doctor

1184
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,700
she died that afternoon,
before he arrived

1185
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,000
but why wouldn't she see a doctor?

1186
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,000
She thought it wasn't serious?

1187
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,300
I don't think so...
she knew she was dying

1188
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:51,500
maybe it was pride, or heroism

1189
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,400
before she died, she said
a beautiful but terrible thing...

1190
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,100
"my mouth is full of earth"

1191
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,100
how did Muriel take it?

1192
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,100
Muriel is like those old women

1193
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,800
who can't cry
over death any more

1194
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:54,600
I've had news of Muriel...

1195
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,600
from whom?

1196
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:00,800
I've had news

1197
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:04,300
she may go to Brussels
to teach English

1198
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,700
she lands at Calais in 2 days

1199
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,600
Calais?

1200
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,200
Muriel, this is my room

1201
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:10,200
shall we meet downstairs
in half an hour?

1202
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,700
Fine

1203
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,800
this way, madame...

1204
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:05,300
Claude finally held Muriel,
after 7 years!

1205
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:09,100
He made his intentions clear,
she could have run away

1206
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,800
she didn't run away, she was ready

1207
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:15,300
she was 30 years old...
she looked 20

1208
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,400
she was new and fresh,
like snow in his hands

1209
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:29,800
he persisted,
expecting her to resist

1210
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
she did not resist.
She fought for the same goal

1211
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,000
he forced her mouth open...

1212
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:53,700
she wanted it, despite her fear

1213
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,400
an unknown magnet
thrust them together

1214
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,400
the ribbon burst...
less easily than Anne's

1215
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,300
there was no tenderness

1216
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,500
Claude's aim was
to arm Muriel against him

1217
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:27,200
it was done

1218
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,700
red stained her gold

1219
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,300
what are you doing?

1220
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,900
I'm leaving

1221
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,100
why?

1222
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,100
Come here...

1223
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,500
dearest Claude...

1224
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:36,200
I came to see you
to bury this thing

1225
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,200
I'm glad you were the first...

1226
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,500
because it's you,
because you wanted it

1227
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:45,500
I shan't cry

1228
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,500
listen to me as you once did...

1229
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:56,700
when I told you
love was stirring in me

1230
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,800
now I tell you that it must die...

1231
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,900
so that I may live

1232
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:06,900
we needn't separate

1233
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:10,100
I took a long time,
but now you're my wife

1234
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,300
it's the first time
I've felt so sure...

1235
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,100
the very first time

1236
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:17,700
we made love...

1237
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,500
you may be pregnant

1238
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
we'll go to Brittany
and wait for the baby...

1239
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,600
by the sea

1240
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:29,400
I was meant to be a mother
and I will be

1241
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:32,400
but there's no room for me
in your life

1242
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:36,000
our love is a dead end,
but it's not shameful

1243
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:39,100
it mustn't be a dead end!

1244
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:41,900
I'm asking you to be my wife

1245
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:45,300
you never were
and never will be a husband

1246
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,500
I'll add this...

1247
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:50,500
my act was morally very serious...

1248
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:52,400
but it was my decision

1249
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:54,900
we're from different tribes...

1250
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:57,400
we learned different customs

1251
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:59,900
I'm a puritan in love...

1252
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,200
you love me
because you're a bit crazy

1253
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:05,900
please listen to me

1254
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,100
it's all true,
but I'm another person now...

1255
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:11,700
thanks to you

1256
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,500
you're not my Claude any more
and it's too late to change

1257
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,400
your value is in your work,
not in your children

1258
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,700
you were my center...

1259
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:25,200
and now I must lose you

1260
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,700
we love a person...

1261
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
for what he is.
We don't try to change him

1262
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,200
if we succeeded,
he'd no longer be himself

1263
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,600
you taught me love last night

1264
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,200
your kisses made me dizzy...

1265
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,600
I still hold you

1266
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:57,100
I can live without eyes or legs...
I can live without you

1267
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:00,000
I no longer fear life without you

1268
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:03,000
your ideas sway me
when I'm with you...

1269
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:06,500
afterward,
they shatter against my religion

1270
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:11,600
I'm not sad for you,
you don't need me

1271
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,300
god protect you

1272
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,000
Claude saw Muriel off

1273
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,900
they had half an hour
before her train

1274
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,600
Muriel seemed happy and confident

1275
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,700
she left and he was alone

1276
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:54,700
between them...

1277
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,300
was a dead girl they never named

1278
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,700
only a birth
could banish the ghost...

1279
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:02,300
by creating a different trio

1280
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:05,800
"dear Claude,
we knew it might happen...

1281
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,800
"and it did:
I'm expecting your child

1282
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,700
"praise god, you're alive in me

1283
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,200
"the paper is your flesh,
the ink, my blood

1284
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,500
"I press to make it enter"

1285
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,200
then she wrote again...

1286
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:33,400
this letter is bordered in black

1287
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,600
I'm not pregnant after all

1288
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:39,600
it was simply
my deep desire to be

1289
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:42,700
we shan't meet again,
however much I want to

1290
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:46,100
we couldn't surpass
our night in Calais

1291
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,700
we recognize happiness
only afterwards

1292
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:58,400
fifteen years have passed

1293
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,400
Muriel is married to a schoolteacher

1294
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,600
they have a daughter

1295
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,600
Mrs brown is dead, the house sold

1296
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,800
letters to the browns are returned

1297
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:12,300
fifteen years...

1298
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,800
France is snown
with corpses and shrapnel

1299
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
millions have died...
few remember why

1300
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,300
fifteen years...

1301
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,400
Claude visits the Rodin museum

1302
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,500
the statue of Balzac
is now acclaimed

1303
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,000
Claude hears English voices...

1304
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,800
schoolgirls, visiting France.
He remembers...

1305
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,200
Muriel's photo at ten...

1306
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,800
and looks for some resemblance

1307
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,700
could her daughter be there?

1308
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:51,700
This one?

1309
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,100
That one?

1310
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,400
Or the redhead?

1311
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,900
Claude looks at them

1312
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,600
he could ask:

1313
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:02,000
"Is one of you
Muriel brown's daughter?"

1314
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,000
No. What's the use...

1315
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:21,900
are you free?

1316
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:23,600
I have a fare

1317
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:30,000
what's wrong with me today?
I look old!
