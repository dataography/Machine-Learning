1
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,632
THE LAST METRO

2
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,974
<i>Paris, September 1942.</i>

3
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,940
<i>Half of France is occupied
by the Germans.</i>

4
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:34,362
<i>The Occupied and Free zones...</i>

5
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:37,530
<i>are officially divided
by a borderline.</i>

6
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,538
<i>In Paris, the curfew...</i>

7
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,457
<i>is imposed at 11 p. m.</i>

8
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:44,671
<i>No one can afford to miss
the last metro.</i>

9
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:49,135
<i>Hungry Parisians queue up
to buy food...</i>

10
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,672
<i>and flock to theatres for warmth.</i>

11
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,141
<i>Movies are just as crowded...</i>

12
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,145
<i>playing to full houses.</i>

13
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:00,683
<i>At the Montmartre Theatre,
rehearsals are under way...</i>

14
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:04,607
<i>though its director,
Lucas Steiner, has fled France:</i>

15
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,663
<i>He didn´t have much choice!</i>

16
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:14,163
Excuse me, Mlle.
I noticed you... I wonder...

17
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,044
What time it is? It´s 6:40.

18
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,672
No, I´ve got a watch.

19
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,381
What else? Are you lost?

20
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,306
No, I live around here.

21
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,798
In that case... so long!

22
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:27,149
Wait... I don´t want you
to think I´m on the make...

23
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,058
I mean it.

24
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,189
Why would I think that?

25
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,409
I was in the café...
making a call...

26
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:38,121
I noticed you...
I mean it was your eyes...

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,044
and your expression.

28
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,169
So I figured...

29
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:46,334
What?

30
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:49,343
Well, this is my lucky day,
so I thought...

31
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,968
we might have a drink and talk.

32
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,058
I´m not thirsty and not interested.
Let me be!

33
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:59,738
You´ve got me all wrong.
D´you think I do this every day?

34
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,405
No, only every other day!

35
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,072
Stop pestering me.

36
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:10,668
Okay, have it your way...
No, wait... let me explain:

37
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:14,963
do you know what it means
to be attracted to someone?

38
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,341
Please, believe me...

39
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,770
I haven´t accosted
a strange woman in... 4 years.

40
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,391
What an honor...

41
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:27,815
Look, that´s enough!

42
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:29,987
D´you want a public scandal?

43
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,864
Think about it.
Let me have something: a name...

44
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,537
an address, a phone number.
I´m Bernard.

45
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,542
You want my number?

46
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,751
Great! Let me write it down.

47
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,802
Odeon 84-00.

48
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,515
Odeon 84-00...
Hey, who´re you kidding?

49
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,558
That´s the Talking Clock number!

50
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,161
Who´s that boy?

51
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:03,831
He´s the concierge´s son.

52
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:06,247
She works at the theatre.

53
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,222
What did he do to you?

54
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:21,145
He patted my head.

55
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,896
Let´s go and wash your hair out!

56
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:26,645
Come back here at once!

57
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:35,751
Is the theatre closed?

58
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,622
No. Go in through the stage door.

59
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,815
I´ve got an appointment.

60
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:51,941
Mr Granger?

61
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:52,818
Yes.

62
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,115
Mrs Steiner is expecting you.
Follow me.

63
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,087
Beautiful theatre!

64
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,500
It beats the Grand Guignol, right?

65
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,595
It´s twice as big...

66
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,466
I´ve been here before...

67
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,390
I saw Mrs Steiner
in "The Cherry Orchard".

68
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:18,473
Any news of Lucas Steiner?

69
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:21,148
The boss? He was lucky...

70
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,441
One day,
they came looking for him...

71
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,237
Here? The Germans?

72
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:28,656
No, the French.
They were buzzing all around...

73
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,414
but he had already
skipped out of Paris.

74
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,663
I hear he´s in America...

75
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:35,458
South America...

76
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:39,093
or around there.
I hope he can work.

77
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:44,429
The offices are upstairs.

78
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:46,644
Bernard Granger... Mr Merlin.

79
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,221
I recognized you.

80
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:53,775
Merlin´s our business manager.
He handles the finances.

81
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,498
Wait here.

82
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,033
A few minutes.

83
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,367
Okay, thanks.

84
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:21,692
Marion, I know Rosen´s
Aryan Certificate is a fake...

85
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:25,868
but they won´t check it
with a magnifying glass.

86
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,623
He´s got no work permit.

87
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,242
He´ll claim he lost it.

88
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,539
We could use our contacts.

89
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,466
No, we may need them.

90
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,379
With the papers he´s got,
he manages to work...

91
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,760
at the film studios.

92
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,643
He´s lucky they´re so careless...

93
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:47,891
but here, we stick to the rules:
no permit, no work!

94
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,573
What can I tell Rosen?

95
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,953
The truth: no Jews
in Marion Steiner´s theatre!

96
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:00,250
Rosen, come this way...

97
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:08,347
I didn´t know you were here!
I´ll be right back.

98
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,970
I´ll go get Marion.

99
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:15,273
Did you explain my case
to Mrs Steiner?

100
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,229
What did she say?

101
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,317
Sorry Rosen,
she won´t hire a Jew...

102
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,194
I just can´t believe it.

103
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:26,079
Anywhere else, I´d expect this...

104
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,295
but in Lucas Steiner´s
own theatre...

105
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,416
it´s truly an outrage!

106
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:40,308
Come in.

107
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,598
Hold it! I want to understand.

108
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,564
What?

109
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:49,483
I considered myself lucky to play
here but if I must lower my pants...

110
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:53,155
to prove I´m not a Jew...
thanks, but no thanks!

111
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,457
Besides, I refuse to take
anyone´s job away from him.

112
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,247
You´ve got it all wrong...

113
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,135
That actor was not slated
for the role of the tutor...

114
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:08,220
but for a walk-on in the third act.

115
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,181
Believe me!

116
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,773
Believe me, Granger...

117
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:16,486
You were my first choice
as Marion´s leading man.

118
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,859
You must realize our position...

119
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,321
We need an okay for the play.

120
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,496
We´re still waiting
for the Censor´s visa.

121
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:28,003
This is Bernard Granger.

122
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:31,251
I´ve heard great things about you...

123
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:35,006
from friends who saw you
at the Grand Guignol.

124
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,761
And I trust Jean-Loup.

125
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:41,315
At first, l was doubtful
about the Grand Guignol...

126
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:44,564
but finally, I enjoyed
playing "The Skeleton".

127
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:47,356
I never saw it
because I work at night.

128
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:49,235
In the past...

129
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,696
my husband managed everything.

130
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,701
I knew nothing
about administration...

131
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,379
and business details.

132
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,009
I had to learn quickly.

133
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,005
Let´s discuss your contract.

134
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,177
Right now?

135
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:06,267
Let´s get it over with.

136
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,687
What did you earn
at Grand Guignol?

137
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,725
I was looking for you.

138
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:16,360
Here´s the script. It´s wholesome
reading. Memorize it, child!

139
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,364
This one?

140
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:19,576
Yes, thanks.

141
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:22,828
I couldn´t find it
at the theatre bookshop.

142
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,121
It hasn´t been published.

143
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,250
I´ve never heard of it.

144
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,719
It´s a Norwegian play,
by a Norwegian playwright...

145
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:33,767
Karen Bergen,
a genuinely Norwegian name.

146
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,683
Lucas discovered it
and had it translated.

147
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:38,392
Do you speak Norwegian?

148
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:42,775
Neither do I. But I bet the critics
will pan the translation!

149
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,244
D´you know Granger?

150
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,320
Is he here?

151
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:49,822
In my office.

152
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,584
I don´t know him...

153
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,250
but we almost met.

154
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,293
Hello!

155
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,795
We expected you at Lucien´s
house-warming party.

156
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:02,632
I couldn´t make it.
We´ll meet again.

157
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:07,100
<i>"I hereby declare
I am not Jewish...</i>

158
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,309
<i>and to the best
of my knowledge...</i>

159
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,447
<i>my parents or grandparents
are not Jewish."</i>

160
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:20,913
How did it go?

161
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,791
Okay!

162
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,666
Great. I´ll see you around.

163
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,835
You never really wanted
to be an actress.

164
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:30,723
I enjoyed the job I had.

165
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:34,103
I know.
If Lucas hadn´t kidnapped you...

166
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:36,805
you´d still be in fashion.

167
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,520
Right, and that´s not all:

168
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:44,117
he said that if I refused,
he´d ask Coco Chanel to fire me!

169
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,204
It sounds just like him.

170
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,289
Can I turn the lights off?

171
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,200
Yes.

172
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,053
I´m waiting for you.

173
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,514
Right.

174
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,354
Oh hell! Daxiat!

175
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,640
I forgot we had a dinner date.

176
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:07,402
I´ll see you later.

177
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:08,858
Goodnight.

178
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,863
Don´t let him see you...

179
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,949
I forgot to tell you...

180
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,570
that I´m having dinner
with Daxiat.

181
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:18,910
He can help us
get the Censor´s visa...

182
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,704
I sort of promised
you might come.

183
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,121
You shouldn´t have.

184
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:26,048
I don´t see how
you can associate with him.

185
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:27,925
I don´t have much choice.

186
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,348
Remember why he panned
"Britannicus"?

187
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,397
Yes, he claimed it was
an effeminate play.

188
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:37,935
Even so, we need his help
for the visa...

189
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:41,075
All I ask is for you to say hello...

190
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,576
and also shake his hand.

191
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,579
I´ll shake his hand...

192
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,915
but no dinner. Figure out
some excuse. I´m going home.

193
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,550
Raymond, cut the lights.

194
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,642
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."

195
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,726
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."

196
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,054
Eric hesitates...

197
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,277
then turns back to his mother.

198
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,648
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"

199
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,741
"l don´t know.
What do you think?"

200
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:41,443
"He will return."

201
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:43,289
As Helena´s embroidery...

202
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,864
drops from her hands...

203
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,335
Carl hears a sound
and turns around.

204
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:49,379
"Who´s there?"

205
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:50,790
He sees Helena.

206
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:52,375
"Why are you hiding?"

207
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,467
"Leave this house.
Your presence here is harmful."

208
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,175
"Before I go,
you must hear me out."

209
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,897
"When Dr Sanders
hired me last Spring..."

210
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,356
Wait... let´s reverse that...

211
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,778
I think it´s best
to start with "Last Spring..."

212
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,364
"You must hear me out."

213
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:12,744
Hello, darling.

214
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,499
"Last Spring,
when Dr Sanders hired me..."

215
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:17,588
Come over here.

216
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,419
Arlette Guillaume,
our set and costume designer.

217
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,677
Bernard Granger...
he´ll play Carl.

218
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,554
You must have seen his act.

219
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:27,886
I don´t think so...

220
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,691
Wait... yes, I have seen it.

221
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:33,021
At the Grand Guignol?

222
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:37,821
No, in a very banal role:
Just a man...

223
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,199
on the prowl.

224
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,080
You can´t judge me by that part...

225
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,706
I was improvising.

226
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:47,163
You seemed to know it by heart!

227
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:49,341
The rehearsal´s over...

228
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,214
but I want to say something.

229
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:54,305
I´m going to stage the play.

230
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,094
Like all of you,
I´d have preferred...

231
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,933
that "Disappearance"
be directed by Lucas himself.

232
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:04,523
Fortunately,
he left us explicit notes...

233
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:06,902
as to the staging.

234
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:09,695
It goes without saying that...

235
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,909
we´ll be guided by his notes.

236
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:16,085
I´ll do my best to help you all.

237
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,218
That´s it!

238
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,341
May I leave now?

239
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:21,802
Run along.

240
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:26,767
What about Daxiat,
the drama critic?

241
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,439
Can´t he help us...

242
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:33,403
He got us the Censor´s visa,
so let´s not make waves.

243
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,073
Can you help me fix my bracelet?

244
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,493
The clasp is stuck.

245
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:42,409
You read palms?

246
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:46,421
What do you see?

247
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,505
There are two women in you.

248
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,682
That´s true. Go on!

249
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:57,523
Raymond, come quickly!
I´m scared...

250
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:00,060
I hear noises in the theatre.

251
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:03,440
Don´t worry, Germaine.
I´ll take a look.

252
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:05,983
Anybody here?

253
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:12,337
Anybody here?

254
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,302
How did you get in?

255
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,640
I watched the rehearsal.
It looks great.

256
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,813
I told you to wait outside, Martine!

257
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:27,141
Calm down.

258
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,903
Look what I´ve got.

259
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:30,864
Still interested?

260
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:33,697
I had no money.
I´ve got to pay for it tonight.

261
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:34,576
How much?

262
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,575
4 200 francs.

263
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:37,988
It´s 14 lbs!

264
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:39,751
I´ll go ask Mrs Steiner.

265
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:42,917
The Grand Guignol
has 100 orchestra seats...

266
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:46,254
200 with the balcony.
You average half a house?

267
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,352
Just about.
A little more on Sundays...

268
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,809
but they average half a house.

269
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:59,521
The seats range
from 20 to 40 francs...

270
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:02,198
A daily gross of 6 000.
How many players?

271
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,277
Mrs Steiner?

272
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:04,362
Excuse me.

273
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:06,697
The ham?

274
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,164
Oh, yes.

275
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,002
How many?

276
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,502
Four actors.
Tree of us play two roles each.

277
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,802
With the costs,
they barely break even.

278
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,341
It´s a losing proposition.

279
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,303
I´m ready. Shall we go?

280
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:33,862
Goodnight, Mrs Steiner.

281
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,159
Goodnight, Marion.

282
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,153
Come in.

283
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:02,657
I´ve got your ham. It´s 4 200 frs.

284
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:03,952
4 200 frs?

285
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:07,668
If it´s too expensive,
I can give it back.

286
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,800
No. It´ll last me the whole winter.

287
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,761
4 200?

288
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:18,644
Right!

289
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,193
Thanks. Here´s the cello.

290
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,237
What do I want with a cello?

291
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,212
Here´s the animal.

292
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:39,462
Look...

293
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,672
14 pounds!

294
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,687
You can´t walk around
with a ham in your arms, can you?

295
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,520
No, I can´t.
Good thinking! Thanks.

296
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:54,524
I´m off. Don´t forget
the lights and shutters.

297
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:57,610
The air-raid warden
is a real bastard!

298
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,703
I´ll remember.

299
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:48,351
Sir?

300
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:50,017
Valentin.

301
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,156
Oh, forgive me.
I´m so absent-minded these days.

302
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,987
No, please don´t apologize...

303
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:58,279
I know I´ve aged a lot.

304
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:01,999
I left a script
at the desk for you...

305
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,873
a screenplay.

306
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:06,629
Read it and tell me what you think.

307
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,252
I won´t detain you.
Goodbye Marion.

308
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,428
This is for you.

309
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:17,598
I know.

310
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,642
Your keys?

311
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,442
D´you have a minute?

312
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:35,757
I keep on getting mail
for Mr Steiner...

313
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:39,304
Probably from people
who don´t know he´s gone.

314
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,512
It´s embarrassing.

315
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,224
Should I return it to the senders,
or give it to you?

316
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:48,313
It´s probably theatre business mail.

317
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:50,321
I´ll take it.

318
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:52,524
D´you want all his mail?

319
00:21:52,826 --> 00:21:53,942
- Yes.
- Fine.

320
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,824
- Thanks.
- You´re most welcome.

321
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:08,754
Room service?

322
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:11,098
No, I ate at the theatre.

323
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,107
Did the reporter
from "Paris Echos" call you ?

324
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:20,604
No. Why?

325
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,995
This morning, he was in the hallway
with a camera.

326
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,410
I told him you weren´t in.
He said:

327
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:31,463
"I just want to take
a picture of her room."

328
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:35,804
He said it was for a reportage
on "The Stars at Home".

329
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,681
I told him to call you.
Didn´t he call?

330
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:41,092
No.

331
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:42,808
Was I wrong?

332
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:46,358
No, you were right.
I hate those snoopers.

333
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,242
Are you watering your flowers?

334
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:23,702
It´s not flowers.

335
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:24,746
Vegetables?

336
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:25,992
No.

337
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:27,576
It´s for a pipe...

338
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:30,121
with a match, it smokes.

339
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,134
You´ll wind up in jail!

340
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,723
Where the hell is she?

341
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,489
For Christ´s sake!

342
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,125
Do we rehearse, or not?

343
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:58,962
We´re waiting for Nadine.
I´ll give her an earful!

344
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,272
You know what time it is?

345
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:13,022
You joy-ride with the Boches
and I get hell!

346
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,857
I was dubbing. We worked late,
so they drove me here.

347
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,411
You´re not squeamish! I bet
you´d accept a role in "Jew Süss"!

348
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:23,245
And how! But they didn´t have
a role for me!

349
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,250
Excuse me. I´m sorry.

350
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,677
Take your time!
You´re only an hour late.

351
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:35,549
What´s your excuse today?
Your alarm clock?

352
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:37,229
No, I was dubbing.

353
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:39,064
Must you grab every offer?

354
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:42,562
Can´t you leave the dubbing jobs
to those who need work?

355
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:43,776
She needs it.

356
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:45,271
She´s a pain in the ass!

357
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:46,191
No, I can´t...

358
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,028
I take every offer I get.

359
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,332
I do radio in the morning
and dubbing at noon.

360
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,335
At night, I do walk-ons.

361
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:57,335
On Thursday, I play Moliére
for school kids...

362
00:24:57,633 --> 00:25:00,125
and if it´s a bit part
in a movie, I say yes!

363
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,966
The only way to succeed
is to accept everything...

364
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:07,896
to get maximum exposure
and make new contacts.

365
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,228
If you want to fire me, say so...

366
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,780
Sacha Guitry is casting.
I can run right over.

367
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,711
Have you anyone in mind?

368
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,682
Yes, I´ve got two men:

369
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:34,347
Raoul Coquet and Fernand Coustal.
Remember them?

370
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,305
Coquet sounds good.
I´ll call him.

371
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:40,901
I´m not so sure of Coustal.

372
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,939
I´ll put a question mark
on his name.

373
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:49,781
Is that her?

374
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:51,704
Yes...

375
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:52,835
That´s her.

376
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,045
Still a beauty!

377
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:54,957
Why "still"?

378
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,466
"The Sin" dates back
to my Communion.

379
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,258
You saw the film? How come?

380
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,012
I didn´t see it,
but I swiped all the stills...

381
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,511
including the famous one!

382
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,267
She really is beautiful...

383
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,528
but she´s strange...
I can´t figure her out.

384
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:13,324
Let´s make the phone call!

385
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:48,666
Lucas, I´ve got bad news for you.

386
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:52,008
The Germans banned the play?

387
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,252
No...

388
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:56,639
You can´t leave next week.

389
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,851
The escape route fell through.

390
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:02,224
You said it was a sure thing.

391
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:03,984
It´s never sure.

392
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,148
The passer who guides people
through Nevers was arrested.

393
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:12,914
I´ve got another lead,
but it´s risky.

394
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:15,664
You´re afraid he´ll get caught too?

395
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,586
No, worse than that...

396
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:22,797
Some passers...
so-called passers...

397
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:25,803
after taking your money...

398
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,559
drive you straight
up to the Kommandantur.

399
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:32,109
So they get paid off
on both ends...

400
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,146
You´re a special case:

401
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,650
some people may recognize you,
or spot your accent.

402
00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:41,492
Let´s stay put for a while.

403
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,456
Will you be able to hold out?

404
00:28:44,752 --> 00:28:46,911
Of course I will... I must!

405
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:52,465
But l hate to feel so useless...
so trapped.

406
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:56,346
Did you talk to Jean-Loup?
Will he help us?

407
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,097
Frankly, I´d rather
keep him out of it...

408
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:03,019
He knows too many people.
He gossips, he fools around...

409
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:04,697
it´s too dangerous!

410
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,278
D´you know how many letters about
Jews are mailed to the police?

411
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,154
Guess!

412
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,577
I don´t know... 300?

413
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,200
1 500! 1 500 letters daily!

414
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,375
"My boss is Jewish,...
my neighbour is a Jew..."

415
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:19,047
No. They all think you´re gone...

416
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:22,180
Let´s keep it that way.
I´ll take care of you.

417
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:27,391
Did you think I was being polite?

418
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,692
Well, you´re wrong:
I want to look at your legs!

419
00:29:37,914 --> 00:29:41,117
Wait, let me breathe in
the smell of the stage.

420
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,510
From the cellar,
I follow all that goes on:

421
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:56,724
when the lights are dimmed in the
morning, I know it´s rehearsal time.

422
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,146
When they go on again,
it´s lunch time.

423
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:03,021
When all the lights go out
at night, it means...

424
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,483
you´re on your way down.

425
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:09,663
It reminds me of a play
I saw in London 3 years ago:

426
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,166
at night,
the husband would pretend...

427
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:15,749
to go out, but as soon
as the gaslight grew dim...

428
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,050
we knew it meant he´d come back
and was up in the attic.

429
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,638
Do you remember that play?

430
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:25,060
I almost acquired the rights.

431
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:34,526
He liked the Grand Guignol...

432
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:36,987
but he´s very happy to be with us.

433
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,585
He´s a little like Jean Gabin in
"The Human Beast": very physical...

434
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,458
and yet quite gentle.

435
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,090
He says it´s because of you
that he´s an actor.

436
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,842
No, I´ll do it myself.

437
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:53,433
Tell me how rehearsals are going.

438
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,982
Jean-Loup is doing well.

439
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:00,271
l was delighted today
when he blew his top!

440
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:09,167
Yes, just a minute.

441
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:13,038
Jean-Loup, it´s Daxiat.

442
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:14,420
What does he want?

443
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:15,750
I don´t know.

444
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:23,388
Hello, Daxiat. What´s up?

445
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:27,565
I heard it yesterday,
in the last metro.

446
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:30,485
They may stop rehearsals
of "The Dead Queen".

447
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:33,073
Why? Is Montherlant a Jew?

448
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,830
You´re pretty warm...

449
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:37,908
Daxiat wants to expose the Jews

450
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:40,079
who still work
at the Comédie Française.

451
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:43,092
He claims Jean Yonnel
is a Rumanian Jew.

452
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,136
I don´t know if Yonnel is Jewish,
or half-Jewish...

453
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:50,769
but I know
he should have run away...

454
00:31:51,063 --> 00:31:53,520
far away from these maniacs.

455
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:56,439
They´re really crazy...
all madmen.

456
00:31:57,364 --> 00:32:00,616
Not only in Germany, but here:
Daxiat and the others...

457
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:02,111
Madmen!

458
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:06,456
You wanted to know
what Bernard Granger looked like.

459
00:32:07,128 --> 00:32:09,121
He´s just perfect.

460
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:13,886
At least we don´t have to worry:
he looks like a real goy!

461
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,304
What have you got against goyim?

462
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,881
Nothing against...

463
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,725
those with short skirts
and long hair.

464
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,265
You dirty racist!

465
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,736
My mother warned me
I´d never be happy with a Jew.

466
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:33,122
"You know, Carl...

467
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,617
if you wish to remain
in this house...

468
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,337
you must never pronounce
the name of Charles-Henri.

469
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:45,383
Everyone noticed
my new dress last night...

470
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:47,593
except for you..."

471
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:49,935
That´s very good, Nadine...

472
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,068
but I want you
to move over to Bernard.

473
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,604
We´ll give you a lamp.

474
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,148
You´ll put it on the table...
it will help...

475
00:32:58,451 --> 00:32:59,995
Raymond, stop fooling around...

476
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,747
Go get us a lamp.

477
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,000
Let´s go on.

478
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,245
"Don´t tell me it´s your work."

479
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:08,085
"I know you work...

480
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:09,379
more than I do...

481
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,088
but some people in this house...

482
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:13,760
should keep...

483
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:16,301
their own duties in mind."

484
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,638
"Why do you say that?"

485
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:21,107
Because... it´s in the script!

486
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,988
Yes, it´s Daxiat.
Go over and say hello.

487
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:36,329
Be friendly. Remember he helped us
get the Censor´s visa.

488
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,424
Don´t worry. I´ll thank him.

489
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:43,300
Alright, kids. Let´s take a break.

490
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:48,428
Who´s he?

491
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:51,818
Don´t you know him:
he´s the lnspector-General...

492
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,272
Daxiat, the drama critic.

493
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,197
Is that Daxiat? I had no idea...

494
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,495
I´d love to meet him...

495
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,572
You´re not fussy!

496
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,248
He practically runs
the Comédie Française.

497
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:06,997
This may sound strange,
coming from me...

498
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,840
but I think your husband...

499
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:12,678
was wrong to leave France.

500
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,390
The new anti-Israelite laws...

501
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,979
apply to theatre speculators
and profiteers.

502
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:21,859
But your husband was a rare pearl:

503
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:25,648
the only Israelite
theatre director...

504
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:27,364
You can say Jewish!

505
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,791
He was at once
a brilliant executive...

506
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:35,125
a talented stage director
and an artist.

507
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:39,009
You see, the Germans
are deeply attached to culture.

508
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:42,474
They don´t want talented artists
to leave France.

509
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,725
But there´s no need
to worry about your play.

510
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:48,895
I´m certain Cottins
can handle the job.

511
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:52,199
Still, one wonders
why this play was chosen...

512
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,698
Even Pitoeff turned it down!

513
00:34:56,622 --> 00:35:00,324
D´you know Mrs Fabre?
She wants to ask you for a favor.

514
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,586
Yes, of course. I know Madame.

515
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,920
It´s about my son, Pierre.

516
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,760
What´s he doing here?

517
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:10,056
He likes to sniff around
at rehearsals...

518
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,473
when he´s interested in a play.

519
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,099
Will he write about us?

520
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:16,272
He will, or he won´t.

521
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:18,691
I wish he´d forget us.

522
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,614
Just stay here.

523
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,024
Look...

524
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:25,902
We´re all Catholics in our family...

525
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,330
Here´s the proof...

526
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,299
Fine... I´ll do my best...

527
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:40,132
Come and meet our little circle.

528
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:45,687
Nadine Marsac, the top student
of the Simon drama course...

529
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:47,608
Well?

530
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:49,648
He´s going to help me.

531
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:50,649
Bernard Granger...

532
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:51,900
our leading man...

533
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:55,991
straight out of the Grand Guignol,
as you see.

534
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,834
He plays Carl?

535
00:35:58,127 --> 00:35:58,708
Yes...

536
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:01,922
Strange... he´d be ideal as
"The Hairy Ape".

537
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:06,509
Raymond will show you the way out.

538
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,180
He doesn´t go for girls, does he?

539
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:14,900
Is it okay to ask you a question?

540
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,361
Look at this.

541
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:20,232
What do you call it?

542
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,280
A fishing rod.

543
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,404
But we also call it a gaulle.

544
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:26,743
Now, if we add a second one to it...

545
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,578
we get "Deux Gaulle"!

546
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:31,424
Bravo, Raymond...

547
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,214
You´re very witty!

548
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:54,121
I speak to you from the plant
of a journal...

549
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,042
that proclaims the truth!

550
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:59,458
I say the French theatre
must drive its Jews out...

551
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:03,009
from the rafters
to the prompter´s box!

552
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,880
For a Jewish prompter
at the "Menilmontant"...

553
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:09,720
will worm his way
to the high command of the Opera!

554
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:13,691
We must oust the Jew
from the stage and the wings...

555
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:15,565
and keep him out!

556
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:20,030
No Jew should be allowed
in a key position in theatre...

557
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,992
for his sordid practices
are bound to corrupt it!

558
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,288
<i>Let these "gentlemen" be warned...</i>

559
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:31,379
<i>that France is off-limits to Jews.</i>

560
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:36,722
<i>Only in this way can true Frenchmen
safeguard their nation!</i>

561
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,309
Here´s the money you asked for,
Mrs Steiner.

562
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:44,362
But I can´t raise
this amount every month.

563
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:46,399
Of course not.
This is exceptional.

564
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,658
In that case, there´s no problem.

565
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:53,033
Hello, Mr Merlin... Come in.

566
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:55,827
Marion, this is Rosette.

567
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:01,546
Put your samples on the desk
and run along home.

568
00:38:03,558 --> 00:38:05,182
How old are you?

569
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:07,766
I´ll be fourteen in 3 months.

570
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:10,473
You´re working...
don´t you go to school?

571
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:12,686
No, I don´t want to anymore.

572
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:14,363
D´you like the theatre?

573
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:15,856
Yes.

574
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:17,988
Come see our play.

575
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:22,666
She can´t come to the theatre:
the kid can´t go out at night!

576
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:24,621
Yes, I can!

577
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:29,087
3 months ago, I went to hear
Edith Piaf at the ABC Theatre.

578
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:33,056
I wore my scarf down to here...

579
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:35,724
so nobody could see it.
There was no trouble.

580
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:40,020
We´ll talk about it some other time.
Go home. It´s late.

581
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:48,113
I´m surprised at you, Marion!

582
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:52,125
Now, that child will insist
on seeing the play...

583
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,169
Her parents hate to deny her
anything, but they´ll blame me.

584
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,511
Forgive me, I´m sorry.

585
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,596
I was sympathetic because...

586
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,171
Are they French?

587
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:04,718
The girl is,
but her parents are Polish.

588
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:07,180
The father´s a tailor.
He works at home...

589
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:09,234
in an attic.

590
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:11,853
He can´t go out in the street...

591
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:14,482
on account of his thick accent.

592
00:39:14,993 --> 00:39:16,192
Like Lucas?

593
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,121
His is much worse...

594
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:20,824
Besides, he hardly speaks French...

595
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:25,004
lf a German asks him for directions,
he´d be trapped!

596
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:29,012
So he hides in his attic
and his wife manages for him.

597
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:31,847
Isn´t he scared of a denunciation?

598
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:34,019
Can´t they go to the Free zone?

599
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:35,975
They´d love to go...

600
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:38,980
but it costs a fortune
and they´re poor.

601
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,864
Got a date tonight?

602
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,038
Not really... I´m going home.

603
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:49,955
Let´s have dinner.

604
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,369
I´m sorry, I can´t.

605
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:54,426
You can´t spend every night
by yourself.

606
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,546
I´ve got to go home.

607
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,106
I´ve read them all,
Mrs Director.

608
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:06,559
Nothing of interest.

609
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,486
You can return them...

610
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,984
but first, make sure to burn
the reader´s notes...

611
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,993
they´re in my handwriting.

612
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,246
I´ll take care of it.

613
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,416
Let me explain
about the money:

614
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,710
I divided it in three wads.

615
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:27,505
The first is for the conveyor
who´ll take you to Vierzon.

616
00:40:27,806 --> 00:40:29,182
They call them conveyors?

617
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:30,556
Yes, conveyors.

618
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,977
He´s to be paid
before he drives off.

619
00:40:33,273 --> 00:40:36,395
You´ll be comfortable.
It´s a furniture moving van.

620
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:39,352
I´ll sit in an armchair,
like a minister!

621
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:41,946
Listen, Lucas. This is serious.

622
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:46,992
This wad is for the farmer who´ll
take you across the borderline.

623
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:50,746
His property is so big
that it extends over both zones.

624
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,837
At the furthest end,
you´re in the Free zone.

625
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:57,674
Let me guess:
the third wad is for Spain.

626
00:40:57,976 --> 00:41:00,303
For Spain and for the rest.

627
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:03,809
And in case you need more,
I brought this.

628
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:16,532
No Mrs! Not the jewelry.
Not – the – jewelry!

629
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:18,285
You may need it.

630
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:21,710
So will you. Bring it along
when you join me...

631
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,799
I want you to join me...

632
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,557
as soon as possible.

633
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,852
To be safe, I´ve got to play
the first 100 performances.

634
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:33,894
Good God! What confidence!

635
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,358
D´you think it will run till then?

636
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,445
That´s 6 months...

637
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:43,996
No, I want you to leave
after the 50th... no later!

638
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,212
I´ll tell them I´ve got a spot
on my lungs...

639
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,253
and to find another actress.

640
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:55,221
I´ll turn the management over
to Jean-Loup...

641
00:41:56,351 --> 00:42:00,433
and pretend I´m going to
a sanitarium. Then, I´ll join you...

642
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:03,267
And we´ll start from scratch.

643
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:22,627
I´m not a barber... stop fidgeting.

644
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:30,733
Don´t. It´s horrible!

645
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:35,739
I´m trying to feel Jewish.

646
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:38,910
It´s very hard to portray a Jew.

647
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:41,578
If you underplay, they´re skeptical.

648
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:46,289
If you overplay, they say:
"He doesn´t look Jewish."

649
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:49,171
What does it mean
"to look Jewish"?

650
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:50,883
Why ask me?

651
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,260
Don´t move around.

652
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:57,802
Listen, Marion...

653
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,736
I love that song.

654
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,197
<i>How could I resist his romancing...</i>

655
00:43:05,492 --> 00:43:08,614
<i>or forget his manly embrace?</i>

656
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:11,074
<i>My heart still believes...</i>

657
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:12,788
<i>all the sweet lies...</i>

658
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:16,291
<i>and the tender look in his eyes.</i>

659
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:18,919
<i>I, who loved him so...</i>

660
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:22,259
<i>the most wonderful man
of St. Jean.</i>

661
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,434
<i>He broke my heart...</i>

662
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:30,987
<i>didn´t say goodbye...
or tell me why.</i>

663
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,287
<i>He broke my heart...</i>

664
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:46,504
<i>didn´t say goodbye...
or tell me why.</i>

665
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:57,851
- How´s the garden?
- Okay.

666
00:43:58,151 --> 00:43:58,982
- Growing?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:01,236
Then, we can smoke!

668
00:44:10,295 --> 00:44:12,287
Jacquot, come here.

669
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:15,670
Listen.

670
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,168
Can you recite?

671
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:18,551
- Sure.
- Ready?

672
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:24,679
Try to say: "´Mother,
do you think Mr Carl will return?"

673
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:27,474
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl
will return?"

674
00:44:27,777 --> 00:44:29,023
Very good.

675
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:31,694
Now say:
"I like to study with him."

676
00:44:31,992 --> 00:44:33,570
"I like to study with him."

677
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,451
That´s fine!

678
00:45:27,155 --> 00:45:28,021
Hello!

679
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,565
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl
will return?"

680
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:32,197
What are you talking about?

681
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,825
"I like to study with him."

682
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:35,666
- What is this?
- It´s him.

683
00:45:36,794 --> 00:45:38,372
- Who?
- Him!

684
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,256
- It´s OK now!
- Good.

685
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:46,760
Nadine, are you ready?

686
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:48,559
You can come in.

687
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:56,233
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"

688
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,532
"Please do. Don´t forget the salve
for his hand."

689
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:01,912
"I´m through, Mother."

690
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:05,158
"Fine. Go to bed now."

691
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:09,467
Now, you walk to the stairway...

692
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:11,917
You stop on the second step.

693
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,511
Don´t fall! Now you say your line.

694
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:16,847
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"

695
00:46:17,145 --> 00:46:18,971
"What do you think, son?"

696
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:22,108
"He´ll come back.
I like to study with him."

697
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,148
That´s fine, Jacquot. Bravo!

698
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,818
At least, we´ve got one good actor
in our play.

699
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,279
That´s nice. Thanks a lot!

700
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:35,826
See you tomorrow.

701
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:40,717
Do I get a kiss too?

702
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:42,636
You get a handshake!

703
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:45,340
Since you insist...
please, allow me...

704
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:47,470
I´ll read your palm:

705
00:46:47,896 --> 00:46:50,898
there are two women in you...

706
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:54,403
Sorry, but neither one wants
to sleep with you!

707
00:46:55,197 --> 00:46:56,314
So long!

708
00:47:01,082 --> 00:47:03,325
It´s my own fault...

709
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:07,626
I was too obvious... too aggressive.
Now, she enjoys needling me!

710
00:47:10,012 --> 00:47:12,634
When her job´s over,
she´ll just vanish.

711
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:16,017
I´ve got to score with her
before opening night!

712
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:18,648
D´you have my size in tan?

713
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:18,983
D´you have my size in tan?

714
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:21,731
What´s this?
Stop bothering Mrs Steiner!

715
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:25,067
She´s no bother, Raymond.
It´s alright.

716
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:30,035
I´ll get you a size 7.

717
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:31,709
Don´t you need stockings?

718
00:47:32,002 --> 00:47:33,710
Sure, but I can´t afford them.

719
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:35,334
Are you kidding?

720
00:47:35,632 --> 00:47:36,462
Not at all...

721
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:38,088
I use make-up.

722
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:39,845
So do I.

723
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:42,464
You even drew the seams.

724
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:43,764
How chic!

725
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:47,348
To do it right,
one needs a helping hand.

726
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,607
GERMAN TROOPS
INVADE FREE ZONE

727
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:52,531
Is that today´s paper?

728
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:55,575
Did you know about it?

729
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:56,948
I heard it on the radio.

730
00:47:57,204 --> 00:47:59,244
People from the Free zone
will be happy...

731
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,793
They invaded the Free zone?
So what?

732
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:11,389
I´ll have to sneak across
all of France instead of just half.

733
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:13,476
No, the Germans are everywhere.

734
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:16,522
They search all the trucks.

735
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:19,439
The passer refuses to risk it...

736
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:22,027
It´s much too dangerous now.

737
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:24,994
What am I supposed to do?

738
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:27,531
Wait till things simmer down.

739
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,538
I can´t stay here. I´ll go crazy!

740
00:48:30,836 --> 00:48:32,496
This is no life.

741
00:48:32,796 --> 00:48:35,124
D´you know
how I kill time all day?

742
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:37,716
I read... I read a lot...

743
00:48:39,473 --> 00:48:42,013
I listen to lies on the radio.

744
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:44,934
Then I read lies in the press.

745
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:48,069
To keep from losing my mind...

746
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,735
I do crossword puzzles.

747
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:53,156
You want to see them?

748
00:48:53,453 --> 00:48:54,734
Just listen:

749
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:59,579
across, in 5 letters...
symbol of infamy: "kikes".

750
00:49:00,254 --> 00:49:03,210
Down, in 8 letters...

751
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:06,427
stinking vultures: "sheenies".

752
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:09,555
These are for the kiddies:

753
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:13,177
"You can never trust one"...
in 3 letters:

754
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,438
the first letter is a J...

755
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:19,900
So l give up, I listen to
the sounds in the theatre...

756
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:23,320
I wait for your footsteps
on the stairs.

757
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:27,205
I wait and wait.
I can´t wait anymore!

758
00:49:28,419 --> 00:49:31,172
How many years can a man live?

759
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,045
I can´t take it anymore...

760
00:49:35,763 --> 00:49:37,674
Please, Lucas...

761
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,142
I´m going!

762
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:44,640
Where?

763
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,862
Away from here.
I´ll speak to them!

764
00:49:48,156 --> 00:49:48,855
To whom?

765
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:51,483
The authorities... the police...
I´ll regularize...

766
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:54,159
my status. I´ll register.

767
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:56,117
Are you crazy?

768
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:58,293
Stay here! What do you want?

769
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:00,047
A concentration camp?

770
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:00,957
Let me go!

771
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:02,504
You´re not leaving...

772
00:50:03,762 --> 00:50:05,423
I won´t let you!

773
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:15,985
Here, it´s real cognac...
from the black market.

774
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:19,449
You´re shaking...
You´d better take a drink.

775
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:24,245
I just realized something awful:

776
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:26,416
I could kill a man...

777
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:33,219
We´ll fix up the cellar.
We´ll get a real bed...

778
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:36,469
a comfortable armchair
and some rugs.

779
00:50:37,352 --> 00:50:39,392
I need a desk.

780
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,555
You´ll have a real apartment.

781
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:46,111
I hope you won´t forget
the wallpaper.

782
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,520
Mrs Steiner wants a rifle
for the gamewarden.

783
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:19,368
We need an official permit
for a prop rifle...

784
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:21,242
It´s not so easy!

785
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,329
It´s what she wants.

786
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:26,204
I can´t go out that way.
They´re here.

787
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:31,178
We should have gotten up earlier.

788
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:33,216
- Use the back yard.
- Right.

789
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:36,932
- Marion...
- Yes?

790
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:39,307
Don´t forget to lock the door.

791
00:52:01,724 --> 00:52:04,096
They sent him to another stalag...

792
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:06,268
but he can´t tell me where it is...

793
00:52:09,401 --> 00:52:13,615
I mail them separately;
one of them might reach him.

794
00:52:13,908 --> 00:52:16,696
They fit me. I´m the same size
as your husband.

795
00:52:16,995 --> 00:52:19,867
He wasn´t my husband,
he was my number two.

796
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:23,918
I got them
at the Colonial Exposition...

797
00:52:24,214 --> 00:52:25,839
for cash, of course.

798
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,356
At times, he was fun...

799
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,395
but what a bastard!

800
00:52:40,654 --> 00:52:41,936
Hello, Bernard.

801
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:45,785
I bet you slept out:
you haven´t shaved.

802
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,409
Yes, I spent the night out:

803
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,871
I ran into a raid for
"Voluntary Labor in Germany".

804
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:56,382
Two guys were checking everybody.

805
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:58,718
So l turn this way and that way...

806
00:52:59,014 --> 00:53:01,886
Each guy thought the other
had checked me out!

807
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:05,648
It´s nothing to brag about:

808
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,777
that´s why our prisoners
can´t come home.

809
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:17,533
How come you´re dressing up here?

810
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:21,333
Don´t broadcast it.
Yes, I spent the night out.

811
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:37,273
I hate for a man to touch me.

812
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:39,943
Can´t you do this instead of him?

813
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,613
You want to know
how I feel about it?

814
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:45,611
Maybe I can´t stand
touching a man!

815
00:53:53,802 --> 00:53:56,009
Don´t forget my other costume.

816
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:58,265
What other costume?

817
00:53:58,558 --> 00:54:00,136
It´s written in the script:

818
00:54:00,436 --> 00:54:03,107
Act 2:
"Carl enters, wearing a frown."

819
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,227
I´d suggest something sober!

820
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,630
You know Granger?

821
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:25,961
The new actor?

822
00:54:26,265 --> 00:54:28,554
Yes. Tell him I couldn´t wait.

823
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:31,304
Say Christian left this.

824
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:33,149
I´ll give it to him.

825
00:55:09,286 --> 00:55:11,992
<i>Marion... are you there?</i>

826
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:13,405
Where are you?

827
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,375
<i>Go over to the bed
and say something.</i>

828
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:20,545
Say what? I´m by the bed.

829
00:55:21,053 --> 00:55:22,085
<i>I can´t hear.</i>

830
00:55:22,388 --> 00:55:24,465
Same here. I hardly hear you.

831
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,095
<i>Go over to the radio.</i>

832
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:30,477
Where is the radio?
I don´t see it.

833
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:33,612
<i>It´s next to the boiler.</i>

834
00:55:34,196 --> 00:55:35,656
The boiler?

835
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,965
Here I am.

836
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:54,259
Is it this hole?

837
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:57,976
<i>Yes. I hear you as if you were
by my side.</i>

838
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,725
<i>Turn the sound on loud
and come up to the stage.</i>

839
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:08,575
This is very dangerous.

840
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:09,488
It´s not...

841
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:10,786
It´s great!

842
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:15,627
I rigged up the old heating vent.
With this set-up...

843
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:19,792
I can hear all the rehearsals
from the cellar.

844
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,512
At night, I can give you suggestions
to pass on to Jean-Loup...

845
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:31,477
Now, "Disappearance" is sure to be
a hit... it could run for a year!

846
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:35,115
I´m back in business:
I´m directing again...

847
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:38,206
but strictly incognito!

848
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:53,225
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies...

849
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,311
lies and contradictions."

850
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:58,061
"They´re not lies, but blanks.

851
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:00,853
They´re not lies, but blanks.

852
00:57:01,155 --> 00:57:04,323
For years,
I tried to find out the truth.

853
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:08,738
It´s dreadful not to know
who one is... what one has done.

854
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,336
Even worse is the fear
it may occur again.

855
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,085
At times, I feel as if
I don´t really exist."

856
00:57:16,593 --> 00:57:20,178
"Why won´t Dr Sanders allow you
to consult a doctor?"

857
00:57:20,934 --> 00:57:24,682
<i>"He knows more than any doctor.
Without him, I´d be dead.</i>

858
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,390
<i>I´ll be eternally grateful to him."</i>

859
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,861
<i>"A prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer...</i>

860
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,612
<i>and Dr Sanders
has imprisoned you.</i>

861
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,830
<i>But if a man
tells you he loves you...</i>

862
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:39,033
why won´t you listen ?"

863
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:40,746
No... wait a minute.

864
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:44,381
Is it really necessary to shout
all these lines?

865
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:48,972
I don´t know...
it sounds all wrong to me.

866
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:52,053
Lucas´ notes are explicit:

867
00:57:52,354 --> 00:57:55,272
this scene is to be played
like a duel.

868
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:57,694
Like a duel!

869
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,647
Alright, but it seems absurd to me.

870
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,615
"A prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer...

871
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,123
and Dr Sanders
has imprisoned you.

872
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,421
But if a man
tells you he loves you...

873
00:58:12,716 --> 00:58:14,508
why won´t you listen?"

874
00:58:14,802 --> 00:58:18,055
"I have no right to love...
no right to love, or be loved."

875
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:21,683
You are simply voicing
Dr Sander´s words.

876
00:58:22,521 --> 00:58:25,524
"I will tell you something
about Dr Sanders."

877
00:58:26,945 --> 00:58:27,645
There...

878
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:32,447
You told me to shout, so I did.
But I´m not happy about it.

879
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:36,080
I´m not happy either.
You see, we´re not happy.

880
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:42,629
Granger´s right.
The scene should not be shouted.

881
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:46,256
But that´s what you asked for!

882
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:48,016
So I made a mistake...

883
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:51,514
Jean-Loup shouldn´t take my notes
so literally.

884
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:53,141
What´s that?

885
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:55,519
An electricity failure.

886
00:58:56,237 --> 00:58:57,317
Get a candle.

887
00:58:57,614 --> 00:58:58,611
A candle...

888
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:00,569
It´s on again.

889
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,377
It shouldn´t be played as a duel,
but as a conspiracy.

890
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:14,301
Am I boring you?

891
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:17,809
Sorry, I´m simply exhausted.

892
00:59:18,269 --> 00:59:20,347
Then sleep here...

893
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:23,441
No, I want to sleep at the hotel...

894
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:25,899
I´ll go home.

895
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:29,318
So, you´re deserting
the conjugal cave?

896
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,369
Goodnight.

897
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,663
Wait... wait.

898
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:41,506
I´m waiting.

899
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:50,476
I´ll see you tomorrow morning.

900
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:55,360
Raymond!

901
00:59:54,863 --> 00:59:55,694
Raymond!

902
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:58,690
Did you see him?

903
00:59:58,994 --> 00:59:59,575
No.

904
01:00:01,038 --> 01:00:02,784
Are you the electrician?

905
01:00:03,084 --> 01:00:06,038
No, not the electrician:
the engineer.

906
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:23,645
Here he is!

907
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:28,362
I know l´m late. While I stood
in line at the hardware store...

908
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:32,247
someone swipes my bike.
So I take the subway...

909
01:00:32,543 --> 01:00:35,545
It breaks down:
we´re stuck between two stations...

910
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,248
As always.

911
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,629
Why not take a bike-cab?
We´d have paid for it.

912
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,804
For his size, they charge double!

913
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:46,886
That´s why I don´t take them!
I´ve got my self-respect!

914
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:48,469
I was just kidding.

915
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:51,729
Can you see me spread out
like a pasha...

916
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,603
being hauled around
by a poor bastard on his bike?

917
01:00:56,619 --> 01:01:00,120
Sure, I know: fat men are funny...
good-natured clowns.

918
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:03,993
Well, I´m not a nice fat man...

919
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:06,207
I´m a nasty one... Go to hell!

920
01:01:10,388 --> 01:01:13,142
Listen, last year they stole
my bike too...

921
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:15,262
so I kissed it off.

922
01:01:15,563 --> 01:01:19,480
But 3 days later,
in another street... unbelievable!

923
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:22,649
What do I see?
My very own bike...

924
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:25,107
No. 813-HK-45.

925
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:27,452
So I figure I´ll take it back.

926
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,662
Just then, a creep walks up...
real cool...

927
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:34,130
I let him unfasten the lock.
Then I say:

928
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:37,509
"Look man, this is my bicycle!"

929
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:42,218
The creep acts indignant.
We swap insults...

930
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:46,185
People gather
around to watch the fight.

931
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:48,607
You know what he pulls?

932
01:01:48,903 --> 01:01:50,813
He calls me a fairy.
No offense, Jean-Loup.

933
01:01:51,114 --> 01:01:53,273
He claims I´m molesting him...

934
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:56,828
making indecent proposals...
the works!

935
01:01:57,373 --> 01:02:02,120
The people give me dirty looks.
They all side with the crook!

936
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:06,881
<i>A real lynch mob! So I beat it fast
and never looked back!</i>

937
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:11,308
There are the Boches, the Heinies...

938
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:16,266
the Krauts, the Jerries...
I don´t remember the other one...

939
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,525
You forgot the buzzards...

940
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:20,196
That´s right... the buzzards.

941
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,244
Say, that´s my record-player!

942
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,630
It´s not yours, it´s Marion´s.
She lent it to me for a party.

943
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:34,668
They swipe all my props:

944
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,295
when it´s not an armchair,
it´s a record-player.

945
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:04,251
A gentleman is waiting for you.

946
01:03:04,554 --> 01:03:06,761
I wonder who it is.

947
01:03:07,224 --> 01:03:10,559
I don´t know his name.
He writes in "Je Suis Partout".

948
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:12,645
Daxiat?

949
01:03:12,941 --> 01:03:14,601
Yes, it´s Mr Daxiat.

950
01:03:18,657 --> 01:03:20,651
May I speak with you?

951
01:03:20,952 --> 01:03:24,571
I wanted to meet you
outside the theatre...

952
01:03:24,873 --> 01:03:28,209
because it´s a confidential matter.

953
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,044
I know you don´t like me...

954
01:03:34,346 --> 01:03:36,921
but I daresay
it´s perhaps because...

955
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:38,423
you don´t know me.

956
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:40,187
I´m not judging you...

957
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,683
but your articles
have often hurt friends...

958
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:45,777
whose work I admire.

959
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:48,065
Others say you love the theatre.

960
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,481
I just don´t know.

961
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,367
Indeed, I am a paradox:

962
01:03:52,664 --> 01:03:54,457
I adore the theatre,
I live for it and yet,

963
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:56,957
I´m hated by most theatre people.

964
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:03,087
It requires strength of character
to cope with such hostility.

965
01:04:03,388 --> 01:04:05,547
I daresay I´ve got that strength.

966
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:08,633
I´ve always admired Lucas Steiner...

967
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:13,567
If he was here, I would tell him
our real struggle is socialistic...

968
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:17,816
anti-capitalistic... that we too,
are men of the Left...

969
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:21,581
but we go further:
we want revolution!

970
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:23,119
You know, Lucas...

971
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:26,537
read newspapers,
but only the theatre section.

972
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:28,417
I do the same. But politics...

973
01:04:28,718 --> 01:04:30,794
You´re wrong:
everything is political!

974
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:33,585
But that´s not what I´m here for...

975
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:39,771
Lucas Steiner is still in France.

976
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:56,123
We´re sorry...

977
01:04:56,422 --> 01:04:59,757
It´s stupid, but obligatory:
everybody down to the shelter!

978
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:16,568
That identity card was found
on a passer who was arrested.

979
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:23,082
Your husband must be
hiding out in some village...

980
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,831
but at some point,
he´s bound to contact you.

981
01:05:27,968 --> 01:05:30,045
Would you give him a message:

982
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:34,008
if he comes back, I won´t write
anything against him.

983
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:36,470
It´s a matter of honor.

984
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:39,230
But if he returns,
you´ll be compromised.

985
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,813
And what about your theatre?

986
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:44,987
The name of Steiner
can only harm you.

987
01:05:45,285 --> 01:05:47,824
You ought to get a divorce.

988
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:53,788
Do you remember, Marion?

989
01:05:55,049 --> 01:05:56,544
Remember what?

990
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:00,879
The elevator
of that department store.

991
01:06:01,182 --> 01:06:02,843
Yes, I remember...

992
01:06:03,687 --> 01:06:06,557
I felt they all knew
what we were doing...

993
01:06:06,857 --> 01:06:08,436
I was terrified...

994
01:06:09,068 --> 01:06:10,896
Only terrified?

995
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:14,491
No, not only terrified...

996
01:06:16,204 --> 01:06:20,120
But the night of that premiere...
There, you were scared...

997
01:06:20,419 --> 01:06:22,246
No, I enjoyed it...

998
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:26,051
Go on... go home...

999
01:06:26,343 --> 01:06:29,632
Go back to the hotel.
I´d rather you left right now.

1000
01:06:31,184 --> 01:06:33,142
What if I stay here tonight?

1001
01:06:33,854 --> 01:06:36,098
All night? Till tomorrow?

1002
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:38,684
All night. Till tomorrow!

1003
01:06:38,988 --> 01:06:40,018
You mean it?

1004
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:44,321
I´ll put out the light
to consider your proposition.

1005
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:51,334
"But if I tell you I love you...

1006
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,838
Why won´t you listen?"

1007
01:06:54,134 --> 01:06:56,887
I know it´s in the script,

1008
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,301
but l´d rather
you refrained during rehearsals.

1009
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:02,097
Save it for the perfomance!

1010
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:03,144
Let´s go on.

1011
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,190
"I have no right to love...
no right to love, or be loved."

1012
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,523
"But if I tell you I love you...

1013
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,369
why won´t you listen?"

1014
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,490
Bernard, you´re supposed to...

1015
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:18,500
caress her face just then.

1016
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:22,834
Marion told him not to touch her.

1017
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:30,139
<i>A large crowd is gathered here,</i>

1018
01:07:30,435 --> 01:07:33,604
<i>I´m trying
to make my way through...</i>

1019
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:35,179
<i>What was that?</i>

1020
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:38,479
<i>I´m told that blast is due to...</i>

1021
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:41,737
<i>an explosive device
in a record-player!</i>

1022
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:45,166
<i>Admiral Froelich
has been seriously injured.</i>

1023
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:47,918
<i>They tell me he was killed!</i>

1024
01:07:48,879 --> 01:07:51,798
<i>The ambush was set up
by some terrorists...</i>

1025
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:54,051
<i>A record-player exploded.</i>

1026
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:09,819
Excuse me, Mrs Steiner.

1027
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,614
I´m busy, Mr Merlin.

1028
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:13,113
Please: this is important.

1029
01:08:21,386 --> 01:08:23,177
I know who he is...

1030
01:08:23,471 --> 01:08:25,630
You shouldn´t sell your jewelry.

1031
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:28,686
Let me take it to a pawn shop.

1032
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:32,271
If the play´s a hit,
you can get it back.

1033
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,694
It makes sense.

1034
01:08:35,196 --> 01:08:36,607
Thank you, Mr Merlin.

1035
01:08:42,373 --> 01:08:45,410
I´m sorry, but I need some time...

1036
01:08:46,337 --> 01:08:47,915
to think it over.

1037
01:08:48,215 --> 01:08:49,626
As you wish.

1038
01:08:54,849 --> 01:08:58,718
Would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room?

1039
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:04,023
The kind of help you want
can be picked up in a brothel.

1040
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:07,275
I can rehearse you.

1041
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:09,902
Never mind. I´ll manage.

1042
01:09:10,205 --> 01:09:13,825
"Carl, if you wish to remain
in this house...

1043
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:17,130
you must never mention the name
of Charles-Henri."

1044
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:22,006
It´s at the perfume counter of
the Galeries. Ask for Miss Yolande.

1045
01:09:22,597 --> 01:09:26,300
She´ll let you have
"Gone With the Wind" for 80 Frs.

1046
01:09:26,603 --> 01:09:30,651
I wouldn´t spend that much
on a black market book...

1047
01:09:31,194 --> 01:09:33,318
but if Marion wants it...

1048
01:09:33,613 --> 01:09:34,693
Yes, she does.

1049
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:36,272
Then, I´ll get it.

1050
01:09:37,036 --> 01:09:41,415
Would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room?

1051
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:43,536
I´ve never done it.

1052
01:09:43,836 --> 01:09:46,709
It´s simple:
you just read the text.

1053
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:48,668
I say a line
and you answer me.

1054
01:09:48,969 --> 01:09:49,964
Alright.

1055
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:55,012
It´s a nice room!

1056
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:56,592
Yes, it is.

1057
01:09:56,897 --> 01:10:01,728
<i>Essentially, they´re profiteers.
Very few come here to work.</i>

1058
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:06,991
<i>The problem is that there´s no way
for most Frenchmen...</i>

1059
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:09,494
<i>to recognize a Jew.</i>

1060
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,876
<i>Ilf we could spot them,
we could protect ourselves.</i>

1061
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:16,836
<i>Some have typical racial features,
but not all of them!</i>

1062
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:19,806
<i>If only all Jews had blue skin,
but as it is...</i>

1063
01:10:20,098 --> 01:10:23,550
<i>we need a foolproof way
to detect them...</i>

1064
01:10:25,897 --> 01:10:28,735
They say: "It´s better
to hear that than to be deaf,"

1065
01:10:29,235 --> 01:10:32,440
but at times,
I´d rather be stone-deaf!

1066
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:37,122
How was our rehearsal?

1067
01:10:37,414 --> 01:10:40,785
Great...
I mean it was much better...

1068
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:44,084
The whispering improves the scene...

1069
01:10:44,382 --> 01:10:47,800
but you could add to the intimacy
by dimming the lights.

1070
01:10:48,097 --> 01:10:52,096
The faces could be illuminated
from the rear... as silhouettes.

1071
01:10:52,477 --> 01:10:54,970
Don´t move...
Remember, you´re silhouettes!

1072
01:10:55,273 --> 01:10:57,314
Raymond... if you don´t mind!

1073
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,064
You´re a genius, Jean-Loup.

1074
01:11:00,363 --> 01:11:03,816
I´ll shift the backdrop
to sharpen the silhouettes.

1075
01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:06,906
What the hell, Raymond?
We´re in the dark!

1076
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:09,663
l know!
The whole area´s in the dark!

1077
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,372
A light failure.

1078
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:13,499
Perfect for a shadow play!

1079
01:11:13,799 --> 01:11:16,588
The whole neighbourhood´s
blacked out.

1080
01:11:16,887 --> 01:11:19,130
You´d think they´d warn us.

1081
01:11:19,433 --> 01:11:21,141
Marc, let´s get some lamps.

1082
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:25,055
I know where we can get candles...
for cash, of course!

1083
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,920
Nadine, we´re waiting for you.

1084
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,553
Let me explain.

1085
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:50,766
No need to.

1086
01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:52,177
Don´t judge me.

1087
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,478
I´m not judging you...

1088
01:11:53,774 --> 01:11:56,729
but try to keep your love life
outside the theatre.

1089
01:12:02,828 --> 01:12:04,656
Marion´s heartless.

1090
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,450
She´s too tough...

1091
01:12:09,462 --> 01:12:11,208
She´s not interested in anyone.

1092
01:12:11,801 --> 01:12:14,720
She has no sympathy for anyone.

1093
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:17,339
She doesn´t know I´m alive.

1094
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,972
She´s worse since Lucas´ gone.
I can´t stand it!

1095
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:27,019
Calm down, child... calm down...

1096
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:30,357
It´s not the end of the world.

1097
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:33,995
She opened a door
that should have been locked.

1098
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:36,368
You see it as a tragedy, but...

1099
01:12:36,669 --> 01:12:39,422
in two weeks,
it will have been forgotten.

1100
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:42,214
I hope you´re right.

1101
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:45,632
I want to go home.

1102
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:49,186
Run along.

1103
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:00,142
Can I help?

1104
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:03,017
No, drop it.
You´re the last thing she needs.

1105
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:04,816
She´ll be alright.

1106
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:07,441
I hate to see her so upset.

1107
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:12,490
Christ! I really was
on the wrong track with her.

1108
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:14,620
That´s for sure!

1109
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,208
She´s no playmate for you...
she´s more like a competitor.

1110
01:13:19,053 --> 01:13:21,342
Were you really stuck on her?

1111
01:13:24,769 --> 01:13:26,808
I just wanted to sleep with her...

1112
01:13:27,105 --> 01:13:30,275
it was like a craving
for a warm croissant!

1113
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:33,524
I wanted to warn you to drop her,
but I figured...

1114
01:13:33,824 --> 01:13:35,781
it was none of my business.

1115
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:41,989
You´re all going to the Joconde
tonight? lt´s a cabaret.

1116
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:46,172
You know what the BBC says?
They say all those...

1117
01:13:46,466 --> 01:13:50,134
who go to night clubs will be held
to account after the war.

1118
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,811
Jean-Loup
wants to boost our morale.

1119
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:01,361
You...
you had the right to be moody...

1120
01:14:01,822 --> 01:14:04,824
to throw a party, or be by yourself.

1121
01:14:05,202 --> 01:14:10,197
Why am I expected to be charming
and smiling at all time?

1122
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:13,915
Even Jean-Loup picks on me.

1123
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:17,798
He´s right.
And he doesn´t know half of it!

1124
01:14:18,262 --> 01:14:21,847
I don´t mind that you neglect me...

1125
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:26,512
but for the others,
the play comes first.

1126
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:30,269
You must pay
more attention to them.

1127
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:33,949
Why don´t you answer?

1128
01:14:35,495 --> 01:14:37,324
I´d rather not.

1129
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:40,497
The coffee´s ready.
I´ve got to run.

1130
01:14:44,132 --> 01:14:45,414
Marion!

1131
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:46,800
Yes?

1132
01:14:47,097 --> 01:14:51,095
I heard you and Bernard
rehearsing the love scene.

1133
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:53,514
So what?

1134
01:14:54,064 --> 01:14:56,734
It seems to me... I feel...

1135
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:58,734
it might be improved.

1136
01:14:59,446 --> 01:15:00,775
What do you mean?

1137
01:15:01,532 --> 01:15:04,820
It´s the only love scene
in the play. Try to be...

1138
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:07,706
more sincere...

1139
01:15:57,364 --> 01:15:59,606
No, this seat´s for Bernard.

1140
01:16:00,576 --> 01:16:04,623
I can´t stay. I´ve got to meet
the producer of "Angels of Mercy".

1141
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:08,790
I´m not sure... it´s between me
and two other girls.

1142
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:12,625
I hope you get the role.

1143
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,132
We´ll pray for you.

1144
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:16,755
I´m off.

1145
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,286
She´ll be good...

1146
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:37,123
but they may feel she´s too young.

1147
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:38,453
She´d be better

1148
01:16:38,757 --> 01:16:40,381
in "School for Wives".

1149
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:42,752
Nadine in the role of Agnés?

1150
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:46,468
When she announces:
"The little kitten is dead..."

1151
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:50,352
the whole audience will think:
"She´s the one who killed it!"

1152
01:16:53,737 --> 01:16:55,647
Enjoying yourselves?

1153
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:57,730
Sit here!

1154
01:16:58,034 --> 01:17:01,950
Well, I´m not alone.
I brought a friend. Simone...

1155
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:03,874
Sit down.

1156
01:17:04,168 --> 01:17:06,839
Take care of her
while I check our things.

1157
01:17:11,762 --> 01:17:13,804
Arlette, sit next to me.

1158
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,395
Just a minute.

1159
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:34,491
Give those back.
I´ve changed my mind.

1160
01:17:45,144 --> 01:17:47,766
Sorry, Mrs Steiner. I can´t stay.

1161
01:17:49,859 --> 01:17:51,235
Come on, let´s go.

1162
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:53,070
I forgot... I´ve got a date.

1163
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:54,740
You´re free. We´re all free.

1164
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:57,572
I apologize. I´ll see you tomorrow.

1165
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:22,484
That man´s staring at us.
Don´t look. He´s coming over.

1166
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,533
Hello, Cottins.

1167
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,110
Still in show business...
a real trooper!

1168
01:18:28,749 --> 01:18:30,373
Introduce me.

1169
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:32,079
I forget your name.

1170
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:33,535
René Bernardini.

1171
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:37,126
Bernardini... Arlette Guillaume...
Marion Steiner.

1172
01:18:41,058 --> 01:18:42,635
I´ll be right back.

1173
01:18:43,143 --> 01:18:44,342
You promise!

1174
01:19:04,091 --> 01:19:07,591
This joint is tacky.
Let´s go to the Monseigneur.

1175
01:19:07,887 --> 01:19:10,046
No, Marion´s exhausted.

1176
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:14,016
Speak for yourself.
I feel like going there!

1177
01:19:14,815 --> 01:19:16,688
Wait for Arlette.

1178
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:18,609
No, you two are kill-joys.

1179
01:19:18,902 --> 01:19:21,147
I´m not sleepy.
It´s sinister here. Let´s go.

1180
01:19:26,497 --> 01:19:27,660
What´s up?

1181
01:19:27,959 --> 01:19:30,202
Tonight, I´m on my own.

1182
01:19:37,598 --> 01:19:38,796
What´s going on?

1183
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,298
That´s Marion:

1184
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:43,639
the party fizzles, so she opts
for an all-night disaster.

1185
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,496
I see Daxiat has two seats...

1186
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:01,663
I see Daxiat has two seats...

1187
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,591
in the 7th row.

1188
01:20:03,885 --> 01:20:06,459
Remember: 20 seats
for the Propagandastaffel!

1189
01:20:07,472 --> 01:20:11,093
Why look at me that way?
It´s mandatory:

1190
01:20:11,396 --> 01:20:13,602
20 seats every night.
It´s a rule.

1191
01:20:13,899 --> 01:20:17,270
At the Odeon, they put them
in the side boxes.

1192
01:20:17,654 --> 01:20:18,853
We´ll do the same!

1193
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:34,963
It´s too much!

1194
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:38,136
We give good seats
to those who pan us...

1195
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:41,057
and we turn down genuine fans.

1196
01:20:41,356 --> 01:20:44,975
Lucas would say: "We give
our best seats to our enemies."

1197
01:20:45,904 --> 01:20:49,322
My purse was in my dressing room.
It´s missing.

1198
01:20:50,577 --> 01:20:52,120
Oh, great!

1199
01:20:59,173 --> 01:21:02,175
What a mess!
Somebody searched this room.

1200
01:21:02,762 --> 01:21:03,343
Well?

1201
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:05,216
They took my travel clock.

1202
01:21:05,516 --> 01:21:07,842
I think that´s all they swiped.

1203
01:21:09,438 --> 01:21:10,469
And you?

1204
01:21:10,773 --> 01:21:13,148
They left my wallet,
but it´s empty.

1205
01:21:14,446 --> 01:21:15,775
It´s worse for you.

1206
01:21:16,073 --> 01:21:20,072
I don´t mind the money,
but my ration cards, my I. D. card,

1207
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,862
my work permit
and my pass were in my purse.

1208
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:26,956
I´m glad
I locked your door, Marion.

1209
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,751
I´ll get the police.

1210
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,925
No, we´ll do the searching.

1211
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:34,632
Just like at Radio-Paris:

1212
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:39,229
some "moving men" came for
the piano. They never returned it.

1213
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:41,481
They were moving men like I am!

1214
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:45,906
That´s fine, but I need my papers.
I wonder who did it.

1215
01:21:46,241 --> 01:21:49,777
Well, I know who did it...
I´m almost sure of it.

1216
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:53,997
Raymond, you know who I mean.
I guess you don´t agree...

1217
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:57,624
Yes, I do! It could only be her.

1218
01:21:57,924 --> 01:21:59,087
I guessed it at once...

1219
01:21:59,969 --> 01:22:00,715
Martine...

1220
01:22:01,011 --> 01:22:04,466
Raymond, you know where she lives.
Run over there...

1221
01:22:05,227 --> 01:22:07,054
No, I don´t know!

1222
01:22:07,354 --> 01:22:09,015
Come on, she´s your sweetie!

1223
01:22:09,316 --> 01:22:11,310
She´s not: she turned me down.

1224
01:22:11,611 --> 01:22:15,693
She peddles her black market stuff
around theatres. That´s how we met.

1225
01:22:15,951 --> 01:22:20,282
I took her out once. That´s all.
I don´t even know her address.

1226
01:22:20,874 --> 01:22:23,082
I´ve never been to her place...

1227
01:22:24,379 --> 01:22:26,373
but she´s a looker...

1228
01:22:26,674 --> 01:22:29,297
I let people think
we slept together.

1229
01:22:30,263 --> 01:22:31,924
Let´s call the police.

1230
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:37,018
I don´t want the police
to seet foot in this theatre.

1231
01:22:37,315 --> 01:22:38,809
This way, please...

1232
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:39,310
This way, please...

1233
01:22:39,693 --> 01:22:41,816
Clear the aisle. Thank you.

1234
01:22:42,487 --> 01:22:44,149
Any seats tonight?

1235
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:46,859
No, it´s opening night.

1236
01:22:52,794 --> 01:22:54,789
That´s Marion Steiner.

1237
01:22:58,887 --> 01:23:01,758
Where is Mrs Steiner´s office?

1238
01:23:02,057 --> 01:23:04,052
It´s on the landing.

1239
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:09,063
Her dressing room is there.

1240
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,901
No. Leave the flowers here.

1241
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:15,153
They´ll poison the air in there.

1242
01:23:30,766 --> 01:23:32,594
I hear them, Marion.

1243
01:23:43,076 --> 01:23:46,911
I don´t see how you can eat.
I couldn´t.

1244
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:48,453
Sure you can. Here.

1245
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:50,875
No, I swear I can´t.

1246
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:54,090
What if tonight´s a disaster?

1247
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,088
We´ll do a new play.

1248
01:23:56,386 --> 01:23:58,094
With what money?

1249
01:23:58,389 --> 01:24:00,928
Have you seen our accounts?
I have.

1250
01:24:01,226 --> 01:24:03,553
If it´s a flop,
we lose the theatre.

1251
01:24:03,855 --> 01:24:07,605
I´m terrified.
How can you be so calm?

1252
01:24:08,154 --> 01:24:11,441
Lucas, you picked the play,
you staged it...

1253
01:24:11,742 --> 01:24:13,403
we followed your advice.

1254
01:24:13,703 --> 01:24:16,789
It´s your creation.
If it doesn´t work...

1255
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,874
if it doesn´t work...

1256
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:22,085
I´m to blame, it´s my fault...
my own fault...

1257
01:24:22,592 --> 01:24:25,297
but we´ll all be up shit creek!

1258
01:24:25,595 --> 01:24:26,461
Have a drink.

1259
01:24:26,763 --> 01:24:29,470
I don´t know how you do it...

1260
01:24:29,769 --> 01:24:31,726
I feel faint...

1261
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:33,813
I´m sick to my stomach.

1262
01:24:34,107 --> 01:24:35,732
Just relax...

1263
01:24:36,737 --> 01:24:39,858
Wait, put this over your stomach...
sit down.

1264
01:24:44,748 --> 01:24:45,744
Thanks.

1265
01:24:48,587 --> 01:24:50,047
I must go now.

1266
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,341
We´ll talk later.

1267
01:24:52,635 --> 01:24:53,548
Sure.

1268
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:55,419
So long.

1269
01:24:55,972 --> 01:24:58,430
I should be reassuring you.

1270
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:01,599
There´s no need to.
I feel gay as a lark.

1271
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:56,218
"Isn´t Eric here?"

1272
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,677
"He was restless this morning.

1273
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,766
He´s probably at the gate,
watching the road."

1274
01:26:03,028 --> 01:26:06,362
"Dr Sanders wouldn´t allow him
to go to the station."

1275
01:26:06,657 --> 01:26:08,450
"My godfather knows best.

1276
01:26:08,745 --> 01:26:12,494
I suppose he wanted to speak
to the new tutor in private.

1277
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:16,540
But if I´d been consulted,
I´d say...

1278
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:18,547
Eric has no need for a tutor.

1279
01:26:19,259 --> 01:26:23,307
<i>He´s too young and I enjoy
teaching him the little I know."</i>

1280
01:26:23,807 --> 01:26:25,469
"You are right, Mrs...

1281
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:29,139
but this big house
is too quiet for Eric.

1282
01:26:30,066 --> 01:26:33,685
My mother says
that when she worked here...

1283
01:26:33,987 --> 01:26:36,278
she often served 20 dinner guests."

1284
01:26:37,453 --> 01:26:40,905
There are 25 of us in Paris:
we´re "public utilities".

1285
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:42,703
"On my birthday...

1286
01:26:43,002 --> 01:26:46,502
when Dr Sanders told me
I could eat with the grown-ups...

1287
01:26:46,798 --> 01:26:47,830
I cried."

1288
01:26:49,135 --> 01:26:51,175
How come she´s going in?

1289
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,714
My son is acting in this play!

1290
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,887
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"

1291
01:26:57,774 --> 01:26:58,639
You alright?

1292
01:26:58,941 --> 01:27:02,941
As the boss used to say:
"When you gotta go, you gotta go!"

1293
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:06,076
"Tell Eric to finish his homework."

1294
01:27:12,878 --> 01:27:15,963
"This is Mr Carl, our new tutor.

1295
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:18,087
I should have warned you...

1296
01:27:18,386 --> 01:27:20,594
The resemblance is striking...

1297
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,170
It´s truly amazing!"

1298
01:27:22,476 --> 01:27:24,302
"l don´t know what you mean.

1299
01:27:25,063 --> 01:27:27,733
But I expected an older man."

1300
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:30,434
"I´m an experienced teacher."

1301
01:27:30,737 --> 01:27:32,114
"I don´t doubt it.

1302
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:35,574
But so far, my son
has been raised solely by us.

1303
01:27:35,869 --> 01:27:39,821
I had hoped he might
be guided by someone who...

1304
01:27:40,127 --> 01:27:43,044
Still,
since my godfather trusts you...

1305
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,380
Eric, meet your new tutor."

1306
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:52,382
"Helena, be wary
of your faulty memory.

1307
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:55,478
Here are his credentials.

1308
01:27:56,274 --> 01:27:59,110
I showed them to you
a month ago."

1309
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:01,739
What a bastard!

1310
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:05,616
"You´re surely right,
I was confused..."

1311
01:28:05,912 --> 01:28:07,456
"Certainly
by the resemblance."

1312
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,825
"Every new face upsets me...

1313
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,500
But I´ll get used to him. Besides...

1314
01:28:12,798 --> 01:28:13,829
Eric seems happy."

1315
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:16,672
"Can I take Mr Carl
around the estate?"

1316
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:18,250
"Of course, child."

1317
01:28:21,853 --> 01:28:23,561
<i>"Listen, Gregory."</i>

1318
01:28:23,856 --> 01:28:26,892
<i>"When will you learn to trust me?</i>

1319
01:28:27,652 --> 01:28:30,608
<i>Don´t you realize
how I cherish you?</i>

1320
01:28:31,116 --> 01:28:32,196
<i>Besides..."</i>

1321
01:28:35,038 --> 01:28:38,124
<i>"l don´t want to lose you."</i>

1322
01:28:42,924 --> 01:28:44,633
Hurry up!

1323
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:49,841
Germaine,
we´ve only got five minutes!

1324
01:28:50,144 --> 01:28:51,722
Don´t turn around!

1325
01:28:52,021 --> 01:28:53,729
How did it go?

1326
01:28:54,023 --> 01:28:55,734
We´ll know when it´s over.

1327
01:28:59,657 --> 01:29:02,362
Watch it...

1328
01:29:02,953 --> 01:29:04,745
Easy...

1329
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:19,011
What´s going on?

1330
01:29:19,309 --> 01:29:20,853
We´re 5 minutes late.

1331
01:29:21,062 --> 01:29:23,186
Can´t we go in quietly?

1332
01:29:23,482 --> 01:29:25,726
"I must tell you about Dr Sanders."

1333
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,351
"You´ve no right!"

1334
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:29,447
"I must tell you, Helena:

1335
01:29:29,867 --> 01:29:33,035
Dr Sanders didn´t come back
after Charles-Henri´s death,

1336
01:29:33,247 --> 01:29:34,706
but before it."

1337
01:29:44,889 --> 01:29:48,425
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies...

1338
01:29:48,728 --> 01:29:51,100
lies and contradictions."

1339
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:53,938
"They weren´t lies, but blanks.

1340
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:57,365
I´ve spent years trying
to learn the truth.

1341
01:29:57,991 --> 01:30:01,528
It´s terrifying not to know
who I am, or what I did.

1342
01:30:02,038 --> 01:30:05,041
Worse yet, is the fear
that it may occur again.

1343
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,285
At times, I feel I don´t really exist."

1344
01:30:09,257 --> 01:30:12,961
"But when I told you I love you...

1345
01:30:14,265 --> 01:30:16,389
Why didn´t you listen?"

1346
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:19,348
I had no right to love,
don´t you see?

1347
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:22,270
No right to love, or be loved."

1348
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:29,327
"And now?"

1349
01:30:29,995 --> 01:30:33,579
"Now, I´m coming to love
and it hurts.

1350
01:30:34,502 --> 01:30:36,625
ls love painful?"

1351
01:30:37,673 --> 01:30:39,630
"Yes, love is painful.

1352
01:30:43,056 --> 01:30:46,509
Like a bird of prey,
it hovers over us...

1353
01:30:47,812 --> 01:30:50,269
as if to threaten us.

1354
01:30:51,985 --> 01:30:55,404
But it is also
a promise of happiness.

1355
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:58,701
You´re lovely, Helena...

1356
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,952
so lovely that it´s painful
to look at you."

1357
01:31:03,253 --> 01:31:05,411
"Yesterday, you said it was a joy."

1358
01:31:05,713 --> 01:31:08,964
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1359
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:28,364
We won!

1360
01:32:06,593 --> 01:32:10,212
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.

1361
01:32:06,843 --> 01:32:10,463
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.

1362
01:32:10,765 --> 01:32:13,222
You understand...
She´s got to rest.

1363
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,513
You can come in.

1364
01:32:16,065 --> 01:32:19,232
Send her a note.
She´ll appreciate it.

1365
01:32:19,528 --> 01:32:22,317
I didn´t know you were here.
Come in.

1366
01:32:22,616 --> 01:32:24,443
My husband´s with me.

1367
01:32:24,743 --> 01:32:26,072
So he is!

1368
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,162
Put them there.

1369
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,719
- You were wonderful.
- Thanks.

1370
01:32:41,769 --> 01:32:44,854
I knew the torn dress
would be effective.

1371
01:32:48,404 --> 01:32:50,646
Sorry, but they insist on it.

1372
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:54,912
Captain Wiedekind and his wife.

1373
01:32:56,998 --> 01:32:59,324
My husband doesn´t speak French.

1374
01:33:02,506 --> 01:33:05,841
Cheer up! You look grim.

1375
01:33:06,219 --> 01:33:08,593
I´m not. Here´s to you.

1376
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:25,655
It went smoothly.

1377
01:33:25,957 --> 01:33:27,665
Except for that louse, Daxiat.

1378
01:33:30,088 --> 01:33:32,165
What are you brooding about?

1379
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:35,503
I´m not. I was thinking
about the play.

1380
01:33:35,803 --> 01:33:39,306
I enjoyed playing with you.
I was really moved.

1381
01:33:40,227 --> 01:33:42,980
You gave a great performance.

1382
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:45,980
I´ll do better in a few days.

1383
01:33:46,529 --> 01:33:48,487
See that man over there?

1384
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:52,233
The one who´s by himself?

1385
01:33:52,538 --> 01:33:54,745
Yes. Please get him out of here.

1386
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,536
Leave it to me.

1387
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:05,128
Remember me?

1388
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,757
Yes. You can´t stay here...

1389
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,310
This is a private gathering...
A working session.

1390
01:34:11,605 --> 01:34:12,982
She´s expecting me.

1391
01:34:13,276 --> 01:34:16,396
She´s not expecting anyone.
She´s exhausted...

1392
01:34:16,696 --> 01:34:18,025
That way out!

1393
01:34:18,323 --> 01:34:19,699
Did she get my flowers?

1394
01:34:19,992 --> 01:34:21,702
Were those your roses?

1395
01:34:21,996 --> 01:34:25,081
They were so full of thorns
her hands were all bloody!

1396
01:34:26,377 --> 01:34:28,703
If I were you,
I´d go home real fast!

1397
01:34:31,092 --> 01:34:31,957
So long!

1398
01:34:42,525 --> 01:34:44,483
Thank you very much.

1399
01:34:45,654 --> 01:34:48,444
You were excellent!

1400
01:34:50,453 --> 01:34:52,660
Bravo, you were great!

1401
01:34:52,957 --> 01:34:54,916
I was? Thanks.

1402
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:02,803
Looking for someone?

1403
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:04,260
No, never mind.

1404
01:35:05,642 --> 01:35:06,971
Are you pleased?

1405
01:35:07,269 --> 01:35:09,559
I´m happy for Marion.

1406
01:35:10,107 --> 01:35:14,320
I don´t understand you.
You heard the applause! It´s a hit!

1407
01:35:14,614 --> 01:35:16,358
A hit... a hit...

1408
01:35:16,659 --> 01:35:18,865
Maybe so, but it´s far from perfect.

1409
01:35:19,162 --> 01:35:22,533
From down here,
you can tell all the weak spots.

1410
01:35:22,835 --> 01:35:25,789
I made notes.
I´ll read them to you.

1411
01:35:26,089 --> 01:35:27,666
Sit down.

1412
01:35:29,051 --> 01:35:31,673
In the first place...

1413
01:35:32,723 --> 01:35:35,593
Are you crazy?
We can´t do that now.

1414
01:35:36,019 --> 01:35:38,772
They´re waiting for me.
I can´t stay.

1415
01:35:39,065 --> 01:35:40,857
Come back later on.

1416
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:42,480
How can I?

1417
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:46,826
We´re all together up there.
You know what it´s like...

1418
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:48,993
Then, spend the night here.

1419
01:35:49,288 --> 01:35:51,959
That´s impossible. Be sensible.

1420
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:54,410
I´ll come down tomorrow morning.

1421
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:57,420
Then take my notes. Study them.

1422
01:35:57,717 --> 01:35:58,797
Alright.

1423
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,344
Wait... look at me!

1424
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:06,094
Where can I put them?
Keep them till tomorrow.

1425
01:36:08,649 --> 01:36:09,895
Kiss me...

1426
01:36:12,656 --> 01:36:13,937
Goodbye.

1427
01:36:32,769 --> 01:36:36,352
<i>Daxiat liked it.
He´ll give us a rave...</i>

1428
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:40,901
<i>Here´s Marion!</i>

1429
01:36:41,698 --> 01:36:43,655
<i>Where were you?</i>

1430
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:46,244
<i>Some champagne for Marion...</i>

1431
01:36:50,001 --> 01:36:52,040
I want the "Petit Parisien"...

1432
01:36:52,337 --> 01:36:54,830
"Aujourd´hui", "La Gerbe"...

1433
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,261
´´Comedia´´ and ´´Je Suis Partout.´´

1434
01:37:00,098 --> 01:37:01,759
Listen to Daxiat:

1435
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,137
"The Montmartre Theatre
has changed its management,

1436
01:37:04,438 --> 01:37:07,275
but not its spirit.
Its new play is a hazy vignette."

1437
01:37:07,568 --> 01:37:11,400
"Hazy!" Sure...
he missed the beginning.

1438
01:37:12,783 --> 01:37:13,566
"Colorless...

1439
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:17,405
and apolitical, it deliberately
ignores our real problems."

1440
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:19,370
Naturally!

1441
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:21,581
"Mrs Steiner maintains...

1442
01:37:21,881 --> 01:37:24,668
the tradition of Jewish nihilism...

1443
01:37:25,176 --> 01:37:28,178
which has always polluted
that theatre.

1444
01:37:28,473 --> 01:37:32,972
The play says nothing about Jews.
Yet, it reeks of Jewishness.

1445
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:38,358
As to the staging
by Jean-Loup Cottins...

1446
01:37:39,156 --> 01:37:42,989
it is merely an effeminate version
of Lucas Steiner´s style."

1447
01:37:43,453 --> 01:37:44,734
Hear, hear!

1448
01:37:47,459 --> 01:37:50,545
"What can I say
about Marion Steiner´s performance?

1449
01:37:50,839 --> 01:37:53,711
It´s all-pathos,
but unfit for the stage.

1450
01:37:54,845 --> 01:37:56,423
Back to the movies, Mrs!"

1451
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,257
See?

1452
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,680
"The only revelation
is Bernard Granger..."

1453
01:38:05,068 --> 01:38:08,152
"He creates a totally
convincing character.

1454
01:38:08,446 --> 01:38:09,989
A star is born."

1455
01:38:10,282 --> 01:38:11,315
At last!

1456
01:38:12,704 --> 01:38:13,949
It´s not funny.

1457
01:38:14,247 --> 01:38:18,294
No, but the other reviews are good.

1458
01:38:18,586 --> 01:38:21,624
With the booking we´ve got,
the play´s a winner.

1459
01:38:22,718 --> 01:38:24,378
Thanks to you, Marion.

1460
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:29,390
Your film fans come to see you
in the play.

1461
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:33,939
"...the Jewish nihilism
which polluted that theatre."

1462
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,646
He signed it, but it reads like
an anonymous letter!

1463
01:38:38,198 --> 01:38:39,314
You´re right.

1464
01:38:40,243 --> 01:38:43,661
Daxiat and company
have the same poisonous motives.

1465
01:38:44,582 --> 01:38:46,661
Before, they were nobodies...

1466
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:49,879
Now, they rule the country,
but for how long?

1467
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:53,711
Look at this passage...

1468
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,051
It´s about you.

1469
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:57,050
Me?

1470
01:38:57,352 --> 01:38:58,051
Yes...

1471
01:38:59,855 --> 01:39:01,267
Look here...

1472
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,733
"Not content to monopolize
our stage and screen...

1473
01:39:09,035 --> 01:39:12,203
the Jews steal
our most beautiful women."

1474
01:39:23,471 --> 01:39:25,678
They sound cheerful.

1475
01:39:25,975 --> 01:39:28,099
It´s a private party.

1476
01:39:54,807 --> 01:39:58,180
The director of the "Hebertot"
wants to meet you.

1477
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:27,266
Miss Bataille...

1478
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:29,306
Mr Daxiat...

1479
01:40:29,818 --> 01:40:33,105
Bravo! Congratulations.
You were fantastic!

1480
01:40:33,407 --> 01:40:35,863
Your article was outrageous!

1481
01:40:36,452 --> 01:40:38,695
Apologize to Mrs Steiner!

1482
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:40,029
Certainly not!

1483
01:40:40,332 --> 01:40:43,998
You´ll apologize
to the whole cast!

1484
01:40:44,295 --> 01:40:45,542
I won´t fight.

1485
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:47,086
Let´s go outside.

1486
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:49,378
You´re insane!

1487
01:40:54,686 --> 01:40:57,095
This is absurd!

1488
01:40:57,649 --> 01:40:59,310
You´re ridiculous!

1489
01:41:00,403 --> 01:41:02,812
Apologize to Mrs Steiner.

1490
01:41:05,702 --> 01:41:06,818
Apologize!

1491
01:41:07,122 --> 01:41:08,949
I won´t apologize for doing my job!

1492
01:41:15,467 --> 01:41:16,796
I won´t fight!

1493
01:41:17,094 --> 01:41:18,589
Yes, you will!

1494
01:41:18,888 --> 01:41:21,263
I refuse to fight!

1495
01:41:24,397 --> 01:41:26,852
I´m not a prize-fighter:
I´m a journalist!

1496
01:41:44,676 --> 01:41:48,047
You´re irresponsible!
How could you do this to us?

1497
01:41:48,348 --> 01:41:50,093
What about my theatre?

1498
01:41:50,393 --> 01:41:52,931
What about our play?

1499
01:41:53,438 --> 01:41:56,939
All you care about is your theatre!

1500
01:41:57,652 --> 01:41:59,277
"How are the bookings?"

1501
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:01,611
"Will we do a matinee at Xmas?"

1502
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:04,282
Yes, the theatres are full now,
but so are the jails!

1503
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:07,830
Listen, we´ll go on
playing together.

1504
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:10,332
But offstage,
don´t you dare speak to me!

1505
01:42:23,107 --> 01:42:24,482
<i>"You´re lovely...</i>

1506
01:42:24,775 --> 01:42:27,611
so lovely
it´s painful to look at you."

1507
01:42:28,237 --> 01:42:29,733
"You said it was a joy."

1508
01:42:30,032 --> 01:42:31,493
"lt is a joy...

1509
01:42:32,453 --> 01:42:34,362
yet it´s painful."

1510
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,406
Look at this...

1511
01:42:59,534 --> 01:43:00,733
lt´s crazy!

1512
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:05,580
Now that the play´s working out...

1513
01:43:06,294 --> 01:43:07,326
you can relax.

1514
01:43:09,214 --> 01:43:11,373
Why look at me that way...

1515
01:43:12,302 --> 01:43:14,461
At times, I feel you hate me.

1516
01:43:15,472 --> 01:43:16,967
Not at all...

1517
01:43:17,767 --> 01:43:20,141
I´d be crazy to hate you!

1518
01:43:20,605 --> 01:43:24,734
You are a little crazy!
I know you by heart.

1519
01:43:25,028 --> 01:43:26,439
I know you too.

1520
01:43:28,324 --> 01:43:30,995
For me,
that play belongs to the past.

1521
01:43:31,287 --> 01:43:32,996
I´ve got a new project:

1522
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,534
"The Magic Mountain"...

1523
01:43:38,214 --> 01:43:41,217
with a great role for you.
Are you listening?

1524
01:43:41,678 --> 01:43:42,424
Yes.

1525
01:43:42,721 --> 01:43:44,381
It´s about a cruel woman...

1526
01:43:44,973 --> 01:43:45,969
Me... cruel?

1527
01:43:46,349 --> 01:43:48,143
No, the character!

1528
01:43:48,938 --> 01:43:52,272
She´s gentle, tender,
in love, and yet...

1529
01:43:52,567 --> 01:43:55,060
she´s cruel.
She doesn´t mean to be...

1530
01:43:55,365 --> 01:43:56,693
She´s cruel despite herself.

1531
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:58,071
Cruel!

1532
01:43:58,368 --> 01:44:00,076
It´ll be wonderful!

1533
01:44:00,371 --> 01:44:03,243
No literature!
We´ll use everyday language.

1534
01:44:03,542 --> 01:44:05,785
I´ll use your own words, you see?

1535
01:44:07,339 --> 01:44:12,133
I see that from now on, everything
I say may be held against me.

1536
01:44:28,285 --> 01:44:29,365
Mr Daxiat?

1537
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:30,992
Over there.

1538
01:44:51,069 --> 01:44:55,115
I was reluctant to come,
but with you, one doesn´t know...

1539
01:44:55,409 --> 01:44:58,031
whether it´s an appointment,
or a summons.

1540
01:44:58,329 --> 01:45:01,201
Apparently,
you misread my review...

1541
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,244
Was that a review?

1542
01:45:03,669 --> 01:45:05,914
I´d say it was a vicious attack.

1543
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:10,879
Assuming it was, it wasn´t
aimed at you. On the contrary...

1544
01:45:22,197 --> 01:45:24,523
Across all the columns...

1545
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:27,443
And don´t forget
the exclamation mark.

1546
01:45:34,173 --> 01:45:37,839
I went to the theatre
expecting to see a play...

1547
01:45:38,137 --> 01:45:40,843
directed by Jean-Loup Cottins.

1548
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,931
Instead, I saw a nondescript show...

1549
01:45:46,231 --> 01:45:47,347
with no style.

1550
01:45:47,651 --> 01:45:51,435
I felt you were merely a front...
and worse yet...

1551
01:45:51,738 --> 01:45:54,029
a mouth-piece for a fugitive.

1552
01:45:54,744 --> 01:45:57,948
Normally, I´d answer in kind.

1553
01:45:58,249 --> 01:45:59,494
But as it is, I´ll just go.

1554
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:03,293
Wait...
I´ve got a proposition for you.

1555
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:05,630
Whatever it is, my answer is no!

1556
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:08,597
I want you to help me save
the "Montmartre".

1557
01:46:11,267 --> 01:46:15,813
Steiner turned it over to his wife
before running away...

1558
01:46:16,108 --> 01:46:18,778
I found out
the transaction is illegal...

1559
01:46:19,071 --> 01:46:21,645
because the transfer
was ante-dated.

1560
01:46:22,952 --> 01:46:26,867
This kind of transaction is labelled
a "fictitious aryanization".

1561
01:46:27,624 --> 01:46:29,452
Meaning what?

1562
01:46:30,046 --> 01:46:34,508
It means that legally, the theatre
doesn´t belong to anyone...

1563
01:46:34,801 --> 01:46:38,636
and the Germans can requisition it.
Unless...

1564
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:40,596
Unless what?

1565
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:46,024
Unless it is taken over
by someone they approve of.

1566
01:46:47,362 --> 01:46:49,818
Daxiat didn´t beat about the bush.

1567
01:46:50,116 --> 01:46:52,904
He proposed that they share
the management...

1568
01:46:53,746 --> 01:46:56,701
He´d select the plays.
Jean-Loup would direct.

1569
01:46:57,002 --> 01:46:59,244
I assume Jean-Loup refused.

1570
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:01,504
No, he didn´t. He couldn´t.

1571
01:47:01,799 --> 01:47:04,291
All he could do
was to stall for time.

1572
01:47:05,346 --> 01:47:08,846
The only way to fight Daxiat
is to appeal to a higher-up

1573
01:47:09,058 --> 01:47:11,468
like Dr Dietrich.

1574
01:47:11,771 --> 01:47:14,098
But Jean-Loup refuses to do it.

1575
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:17,855
Dr Dietrich, please.

1576
01:47:18,156 --> 01:47:20,612
On the first floor.

1577
01:47:28,712 --> 01:47:31,002
You´ll have to wait.

1578
01:48:05,808 --> 01:48:07,469
Dr Dietrich, please.

1579
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:09,099
That´s impossible.

1580
01:48:09,397 --> 01:48:11,141
I called him.
He´s expecting me.

1581
01:48:11,441 --> 01:48:12,722
What´s your name?

1582
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:14,522
Marion Steiner.

1583
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:18,151
I see you´ve got a 5 p. m.
appointment...

1584
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:19,994
but it´s impossible.

1585
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:21,747
I don´t mind waiting.

1586
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,246
I´m sorry.
It´s useless to wait:

1587
01:48:24,543 --> 01:48:27,117
Dr Dietrich left
for the Eastern front.

1588
01:48:27,421 --> 01:48:30,176
He was recalled for active duty.

1589
01:48:30,468 --> 01:48:31,963
Then, that´s that.

1590
01:48:37,853 --> 01:48:40,642
Mrs Steiner,
I´d like a word with you.

1591
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:52,739
I´m an admirer of yours...

1592
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:55,208
I am Lieutenant Berger.

1593
01:48:56,548 --> 01:48:58,423
About Dr Dietrich...

1594
01:49:00,762 --> 01:49:05,842
He´s not on the Eastern front:
he shot himself last night.

1595
01:49:08,732 --> 01:49:09,894
It´s tragic...

1596
01:49:10,485 --> 01:49:12,693
He admired you enormously...

1597
01:49:13,197 --> 01:49:15,024
and so do I.

1598
01:49:16,118 --> 01:49:18,574
It´s an honor to shake your hand.

1599
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:16,243
I must speak to you.

1600
01:52:16,543 --> 01:52:19,379
I´m sorry,
but it´s absolutely necessary.

1601
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,509
I´m leaving the theatre.

1602
01:52:22,803 --> 01:52:25,840
But I´ll give you time to find
another actor.

1603
01:52:26,849 --> 01:52:29,176
I should have expected this.

1604
01:52:29,479 --> 01:52:32,185
No, it´s not what you think...

1605
01:52:34,153 --> 01:52:36,645
You can´t forgive my row
with Daxiat...

1606
01:52:36,948 --> 01:52:39,191
and I understand your reaction.

1607
01:52:41,455 --> 01:52:44,291
But even if you won´t speak to me,

1608
01:52:45,668 --> 01:52:47,663
we are a good acting-team.

1609
01:52:47,965 --> 01:52:52,295
I love the play and I love my role.
So it´s not that.

1610
01:52:52,596 --> 01:52:54,803
There´s no need to justify yourself.

1611
01:52:56,018 --> 01:52:58,854
I´m not even sure
we´ll replace you...

1612
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:02,066
The theatre
may soon be shut down.

1613
01:53:02,986 --> 01:53:06,191
I suppose you got a better offer
from Hebertot.

1614
01:53:06,491 --> 01:53:10,027
No, it´s not for Hebertot
or any other theatre.

1615
01:53:10,331 --> 01:53:13,665
I´m temporarily giving up acting...

1616
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:16,880
to join the Resistance.

1617
01:53:21,638 --> 01:53:24,807
"Helena, I wish to speak to Mr Carl
in private."

1618
01:53:25,102 --> 01:53:26,893
"If it´s about my son...

1619
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:30,563
I have the right to listen."

1620
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,316
Civil Defense!

1621
01:53:33,613 --> 01:53:35,155
Cellar inspection!

1622
01:53:35,615 --> 01:53:37,241
"Mr Carl, isn´t it unfair?

1623
01:53:37,535 --> 01:53:40,206
As Eric´s mother,
I have the right to know."

1624
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:42,622
"Frankly, Dr Sanders...

1625
01:53:42,918 --> 01:53:44,496
this is embarrassing."

1626
01:53:45,255 --> 01:53:47,082
"Never mind, Mr Carl.

1627
01:53:47,384 --> 01:53:49,791
Helena, please do as I say."

1628
01:53:50,595 --> 01:53:53,551
"Since you insist, I´ll leave."

1629
01:53:54,977 --> 01:53:56,556
"This is what happened:

1630
01:53:57,314 --> 01:54:01,230
last October, she went for a walk...

1631
01:54:01,529 --> 01:54:03,189
and simply disappeared."

1632
01:54:03,489 --> 01:54:04,818
It´s for the cellar.

1633
01:54:05,117 --> 01:54:06,529
- The cellar?
- Yes.

1634
01:54:06,829 --> 01:54:07,991
Out of the question!

1635
01:54:08,288 --> 01:54:10,745
"When she came back,
she was unable...

1636
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,621
to tell us where she´d been."

1637
01:54:13,547 --> 01:54:15,125
"Was she amnesic?"

1638
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,623
"I suppose so."

1639
01:54:18,886 --> 01:54:20,964
Put them in a side box.

1640
01:54:23,227 --> 01:54:24,971
Follow me.

1641
01:54:25,897 --> 01:54:27,273
"You´re right...

1642
01:54:27,567 --> 01:54:31,862
Helena´s dependency on me
may seem peculiar.

1643
01:54:32,281 --> 01:54:35,617
She behaves like a child.

1644
01:54:36,413 --> 01:54:39,166
Her gratitude is excessive."

1645
01:54:41,045 --> 01:54:43,334
"At times, she seems too humble."

1646
01:54:43,631 --> 01:54:46,966
"Why she feels guilty,
I don´t know.

1647
01:54:47,929 --> 01:54:50,847
But whatever it is, it leads her...

1648
01:54:51,141 --> 01:54:53,977
to seek the affection
of her inferiors:

1649
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:57,606
Charles-Henri
was bewildered by it.

1650
01:54:57,901 --> 01:54:59,811
And then the tragedy occured."

1651
01:55:00,988 --> 01:55:02,449
"What tragedy?"

1652
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:13,082
"I know Dr Sanders...

1653
01:55:13,382 --> 01:55:16,634
came back before
Charles-Henri´s death!"

1654
01:55:25,358 --> 01:55:26,603
D´you know them?

1655
01:55:26,901 --> 01:55:27,897
Civil Defense.

1656
01:55:28,195 --> 01:55:31,032
No, they´re Gestapo men.
I know one of them.

1657
01:55:31,492 --> 01:55:32,607
Gestapo?

1658
01:55:33,036 --> 01:55:34,696
- Will you help me?
- Yes.

1659
01:55:34,996 --> 01:55:36,277
But no questions!

1660
01:55:37,792 --> 01:55:39,252
"Love is painful.

1661
01:55:39,546 --> 01:55:42,167
Like a bird of prey,
it hovers over us...

1662
01:55:42,465 --> 01:55:44,045
as if to threaten us.

1663
01:55:44,344 --> 01:55:47,096
But it is also a promise
of happiness.

1664
01:55:48,892 --> 01:55:50,886
You´re so lovely, Helena...

1665
01:55:51,687 --> 01:55:54,180
that it´s painful to look at you."

1666
01:55:55,526 --> 01:55:56,856
"You said it was a joy."

1667
01:55:57,154 --> 01:55:59,528
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1668
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,455
No curtain calls tonight.

1669
01:56:12,801 --> 01:56:13,964
What´s up?

1670
01:56:14,261 --> 01:56:16,967
It´s Civil Defense...
to inspect the cellar.

1671
01:56:37,127 --> 01:56:39,252
This is Bernard Granger.

1672
01:56:39,548 --> 01:56:41,340
Bernard... my husband.

1673
01:56:53,652 --> 01:56:57,437
Don´t just stand there! You´ve got
to conceal all this and hide!

1674
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:06,411
Take us to the cellar!

1675
01:57:06,712 --> 01:57:09,715
No... wait for Mrs Steiner.

1676
01:57:12,094 --> 01:57:13,090
I´m going in.

1677
01:57:13,388 --> 01:57:15,050
No, she´s not dressed.

1678
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:17,474
Let´s be gentlemanly.

1679
01:57:19,272 --> 01:57:20,896
So I made a mistake!

1680
01:57:21,775 --> 01:57:23,354
Be patient.

1681
01:57:23,653 --> 01:57:25,196
I´ll be right out.

1682
01:57:35,127 --> 01:57:38,332
I never go down there.
It´s probably full of rats.

1683
01:57:38,548 --> 01:57:40,092
Have you got the key?

1684
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:43,512
Watch your heads!

1685
01:57:58,870 --> 01:58:02,572
Seems to me it´s not deep enough
for a shelter.

1686
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:05,962
There´s about 8"
between the ceiling and the yard.

1687
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:11,795
What´s this?

1688
01:58:12,097 --> 01:58:14,305
We used it in "The Cherry Orchard".

1689
01:58:15,812 --> 01:58:18,269
There´s only room for 40 people.

1690
01:58:18,816 --> 01:58:22,352
In any case,
it´s been condemned since 39.

1691
01:58:24,073 --> 01:58:26,696
During air-raids,
we use the subway.

1692
01:58:26,995 --> 01:58:29,866
The local station is open all night.

1693
01:58:32,628 --> 01:58:36,674
Can we use that staircase
for firewood?

1694
01:58:46,814 --> 01:58:48,938
There are so many air-raids now...

1695
01:58:49,234 --> 01:58:51,524
nobody bothers to go down.

1696
01:58:55,076 --> 01:58:58,447
Well, they cleared out...
till the next time.

1697
01:59:00,042 --> 01:59:02,249
This is a hell of a life!

1698
01:59:02,545 --> 01:59:04,455
It´s a life... it´s my life.

1699
01:59:05,591 --> 01:59:08,131
Can´t you find
a better hiding place?

1700
01:59:09,055 --> 01:59:11,973
I don´t want one.
This is my place...

1701
01:59:14,855 --> 01:59:17,015
and this is where I stay!

1702
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:21,149
My wife is beautiful,
isn´t she?

1703
01:59:23,826 --> 01:59:25,784
Let me ask you a question:

1704
01:59:26,538 --> 01:59:30,372
she´s in love with you,
but do you love her?

1705
01:59:37,137 --> 01:59:39,547
"I´m coming to love and it hurts.

1706
01:59:37,512 --> 01:59:39,922
I´m coming to love and it hurts.

1707
01:59:41,727 --> 01:59:43,009
Is love painful?"

1708
01:59:43,313 --> 01:59:45,021
"Yes, love is painful.

1709
01:59:45,315 --> 01:59:47,939
Like birds of prey,
it hovers over us...

1710
01:59:48,237 --> 01:59:50,397
as if to threaten us.

1711
01:59:50,699 --> 01:59:52,988
But it is a promise of happiness.

1712
01:59:58,209 --> 01:59:59,752
You´re so lovely...

1713
02:00:00,336 --> 02:00:03,124
that it´s painful to look at you."

1714
02:00:03,967 --> 02:00:05,759
"You said it was a joy."

1715
02:00:06,054 --> 02:00:08,676
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1716
02:00:18,822 --> 02:00:21,609
Bernard, may I ask you something?

1717
02:00:22,911 --> 02:00:25,914
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

1718
02:00:26,208 --> 02:00:27,619
Of course not...

1719
02:00:29,003 --> 02:00:31,757
I was waiting
for the rehearsal to end.

1720
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:34,542
Well, it´s over now. It was sad...

1721
02:00:35,555 --> 02:00:37,048
I watched it.

1722
02:00:37,556 --> 02:00:38,257
Well?

1723
02:00:38,559 --> 02:00:39,805
He was good.

1724
02:00:40,396 --> 02:00:43,516
It´s a lesson in humility:
we´re all expendable.

1725
02:00:48,324 --> 02:00:51,029
Well, goodbye Bernard...

1726
02:01:13,108 --> 02:01:16,359
I felt you were interested
in all women...

1727
02:01:16,655 --> 02:01:18,233
except for me.

1728
02:01:18,532 --> 02:01:20,359
First, it´s not all women...

1729
02:01:21,745 --> 02:01:23,621
and you intimidated me.

1730
02:01:23,915 --> 02:01:26,372
You seemed to disapprove of me.

1731
02:01:26,669 --> 02:01:29,506
At times,
you were downright hostile.

1732
02:01:29,966 --> 02:01:31,425
Hostile?

1733
02:01:31,719 --> 02:01:34,007
Yes, I felt you were judging me.

1734
02:01:34,305 --> 02:01:35,504
It´s just the opposite!

1735
02:01:36,476 --> 02:01:39,394
I was so attracted to you...

1736
02:01:41,107 --> 02:01:45,356
that I covered up
so nobody would notice...

1737
02:01:46,615 --> 02:01:48,609
and I made you hate me.

1738
02:01:48,911 --> 02:01:51,485
That´s not true.
I never hated you.

1739
02:01:53,625 --> 02:01:57,210
But why did you act so distant
after you´d kissed me?

1740
02:01:57,799 --> 02:01:59,672
All actors kiss each other.

1741
02:01:59,968 --> 02:02:01,676
But not on the mouth!

1742
02:02:02,471 --> 02:02:04,630
I kissed you on the mouth?

1743
02:02:05,059 --> 02:02:05,925
Yes...

1744
02:02:06,937 --> 02:02:10,473
on opening night.

1745
02:02:11,276 --> 02:02:13,150
I couldn´t have!

1746
02:02:13,445 --> 02:02:16,020
You kissed me on the mouth!

1747
02:02:18,954 --> 02:02:21,279
I know: you see two women in me.

1748
02:02:22,459 --> 02:02:23,408
I do:

1749
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:27,752
I see two women in you:

1750
02:02:28,759 --> 02:02:30,254
one who no longer
loves her husband...

1751
02:02:30,553 --> 02:02:31,717
No, don´t...

1752
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:36,640
You wouldn´t understand.

1753
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:49,906
Don´t forget your make-up.

1754
02:02:50,332 --> 02:02:51,708
I won´t need it.

1755
02:02:53,295 --> 02:02:55,204
I´ll leave it for my successor.

1756
02:02:57,342 --> 02:02:59,419
I won´t be using any make-up.

1757
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:02,802
But you may need a disguise.

1758
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:05,341
Forgive me...

1759
02:03:42,991 --> 02:03:46,907
<i>And so, Lucien Ballard
took over the part of Carl.</i>

1760
02:03:53,005 --> 02:03:54,630
<i>Nadine Marsac, now famous,</i>

1761
02:03:54,841 --> 02:03:57,547
<i>rushes off
right after her final lines.</i>

1762
02:03:57,762 --> 02:04:00,847
<i>A chauffeur drives her
to the studios...</i>

1763
02:04:01,141 --> 02:04:04,263
<i>where they´re shooting
"Angels of Mercy" at night.</i>

1764
02:04:05,024 --> 02:04:08,524
<i>Arlette Guillaume
is the art director of the film.</i>

1765
02:04:10,572 --> 02:04:13,360
<i>In June 1944,
the Allies land in Normandy.</i>

1766
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,987
<i>Despite the daily hardships...</i>

1767
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:19,706
<i>Parisians keep on crowding
the theatres.</i>

1768
02:04:24,593 --> 02:04:25,507
<i>One night...</i>

1769
02:04:25,802 --> 02:04:27,428
<i>ignoring the sirens...</i>

1770
02:04:27,722 --> 02:04:29,762
<i>the audience stood outside...</i>

1771
02:04:30,059 --> 02:04:33,228
<i>to watch the ballet
of the RAF planes in the sky.</i>

1772
02:04:44,121 --> 02:04:47,206
<i>Many theatres are shut down
for lack of electricity.</i>

1773
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:51,960
<i>Thanks to Raymond´s ingenuity,
the "Montmartre" remains open.</i>

1774
02:04:53,259 --> 02:04:57,093
<i>He´s replaced the footlights
by auto headlights</i>

1775
02:05:04,274 --> 02:05:06,482
<i>Germany´s defeat
is now inevitable.</i>

1776
02:05:06,779 --> 02:05:09,982
<i>After 813 days and nights
in his dark cellar...</i>

1777
02:05:10,283 --> 02:05:12,526
<i>Lucas Steiner is impatient
to see daylight.</i>

1778
02:05:13,789 --> 02:05:15,034
<i>The street...</i>

1779
02:05:15,374 --> 02:05:19,040
<i>is a scene of confusion
and sporadic shooting.</i>

1780
02:05:27,976 --> 02:05:28,592
No...

1781
02:05:28,894 --> 02:05:30,269
Not there!

1782
02:05:44,124 --> 02:05:46,497
<i>It´s a hectic period for Jean-Loup.</i>

1783
02:05:46,794 --> 02:05:48,420
<i>Arrested by the F.F.I.,</i>

1784
02:05:48,715 --> 02:05:51,919
<i>he is released
thanks to his connections...</i>

1785
02:05:52,219 --> 02:05:55,554
<i>but re-arrested the next day
because of his connections.</i>

1786
02:05:58,186 --> 02:06:01,141
<i>As for Daxiat,
he is a man on the run.</i>

1787
02:06:02,984 --> 02:06:05,821
<i>The one-time press lord
is now a pariah.</i>

1788
02:06:06,114 --> 02:06:08,690
<i>He´s survived the bombing
of Hamburg.</i>

1789
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:11,283
<i>After following Petain to Germany...</i>

1790
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:14,618
<i>he reaches Spain
via a series of monasteries.</i>

1791
02:06:14,918 --> 02:06:16,414
<i>Sentenced to death in absentia,</i>

1792
02:06:16,630 --> 02:06:19,465
<i>he will die of a cancer
in the ´60´s.</i>

1793
02:06:20,927 --> 02:06:23,502
<i>But let us go back
to the summer of 1944...</i>

1794
02:06:23,806 --> 02:06:25,716
<i>and to our story.</i>

1795
02:07:14,212 --> 02:07:16,455
I tried to forget you. I couldn´t.

1796
02:07:16,757 --> 02:07:19,760
If not for your pride,
I´d have come sooner.

1797
02:07:20,054 --> 02:07:23,674
You´d have had to make up
a lie each time you came.

1798
02:07:23,976 --> 02:07:26,849
Why should I lie? And to whom?
He´s dead now.

1799
02:07:27,649 --> 02:07:29,440
But you´ve got your career...

1800
02:07:29,734 --> 02:07:33,817
No. I realized I didn´t care
about it anymore...

1801
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:35,944
I gave it all up.

1802
02:07:36,912 --> 02:07:39,583
The only thing that matters to me...

1803
02:07:39,874 --> 02:07:43,042
is to be with you,
to get you out of here.

1804
02:07:43,337 --> 02:07:45,246
We can start all over again.

1805
02:07:45,548 --> 02:07:47,008
No we can´t.

1806
02:07:47,468 --> 02:07:50,423
There was never anything...

1807
02:07:50,806 --> 02:07:52,005
anything real...

1808
02:07:52,308 --> 02:07:53,388
between us.

1809
02:07:53,686 --> 02:07:54,800
I toyed with the idea...

1810
02:07:55,104 --> 02:07:57,477
but I never really loved you.

1811
02:07:58,817 --> 02:08:01,311
It was an abstract notion.

1812
02:08:02,156 --> 02:08:05,527
You believed in it
because I believed it myself.

1813
02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:09,864
I never stopped thinking of you...
not even for a day.

1814
02:08:10,251 --> 02:08:11,876
I thought of you too...

1815
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:13,915
but less and less often.

1816
02:08:14,132 --> 02:08:16,541
And now, I don´t know
what you´re doing here.

1817
02:08:16,761 --> 02:08:20,011
I´ve almost forgotten your name...

1818
02:08:21,475 --> 02:08:25,855
I barely remember
the way you look.

1819
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:27,645
Go away!

1820
02:08:31,866 --> 02:08:34,274
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.

1821
02:08:34,577 --> 02:08:36,406
It takes two to love...

1822
02:08:36,789 --> 02:08:40,242
as it takes two to hate.
And I´ll go on loving you.

1823
02:08:41,088 --> 02:08:44,873
You make my heart beat faster.
Nothing else matters to me.

1824
02:08:46,637 --> 02:08:47,882
Goodbye.

1825
02:09:31,034 --> 02:09:32,363
There´s Steiner!

1826
02:09:35,374 --> 02:09:36,288
He´s back!
