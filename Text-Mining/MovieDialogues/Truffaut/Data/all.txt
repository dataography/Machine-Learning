00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:28,167
LOVE AT TWENTY

2
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,126
<i>Mornings, I wake up singing</i>

3
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:59,667
<i>At night, I dance to bed</i>

4
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,292
<i>I never care</i>

5
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,834
<i>About the bombs in the air</i>

6
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,959
<i>That one day will kill us all dead</i>

7
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,876
<i>We don't get enough care!</i>

8
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:17,209
<i>Antoine Doinel is now 20.</i>

9
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,376
<i>His mischievous pranks
brought him before the judge.</i>

10
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:24,042
<i>After escaping from a home, he feels free.</i>

11
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,542
<i>Antoine carefully organised
an independent life.</i>

12
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,792
<i>A music lover,
he found work in a record house.</i>

13
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,917
<i>He finally fulfilled his dream,</i>

14
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,876
<i>living alone with a salary,</i>

15
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,334
<i>standing on his own two feet.</i>

16
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:52,626
<i>He enrols in a youth music club
and never misses a meeting.</i>

17
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:57,251
<i>He also manages to get free tickets
for important concerts.</i>

18
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:59,626
<i>His only friend is René Biget,</i>

19
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,709
<i>a stock trader.</i>

20
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,084
How's the stock market?

21
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,084
Fine. I'll be a broker soon.

22
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,792
I'm going into the factory.

23
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,626
I got two tickets tonight for Shapiro.

24
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:15,417
Remember the time you hid in my room
and Pa came in? So much smoke!

25
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,417
My old man!

26
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:21,501
Help me wave the blankets to air the smoke!

27
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,667
That's enough!

28
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:35,292
It's a smokehouse in here!

29
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,376
A gambling den!

30
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,751
I'll take three cigars off your allowance!

31
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:44,876
Bucephalus is no coat rack!

32
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,459
It's worth thousands!
It's a work of art!

33
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,001
I'd never sell it.

34
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:58,542
Now be good and go to sleep!

35
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,084
Good night!

36
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,667
He almost saw me!

37
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,251
He saw your feet but said nothing.

38
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:15,167
Time to go.

39
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:29,667
I never noticed her. I really like her.

40
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:32,792
A lot! Like her friend?

41
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,626
It'd be practical!

42
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,876
I'm in love with my cousin.
She has long hair.

43
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:43,084
She wants to get it cut. Great!

44
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,584
She loves you?

45
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,834
I don't know. I've said nothing.
If I like her short hair,

46
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,209
- I'll tell her by mail.
- Tell me how it goes.

47
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,584
8 DAYS LATER

48
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:57,959
I saw her three times last week.
I didn't speak, but she saw me.

49
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,084
Last Tuesday at the <i>Eroica,</i>

50
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,001
<i>I was sitting behind her.</i>

51
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,084
<i>She undid her scarf.
I watched her neck and hair.</i>

52
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,417
<i>I stared all evening!</i>

53
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:13,917
<i>I decided to talk to her and hurried out,</i>

54
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,959
<i>but she met a friend.</i>

55
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,542
<i>So I went home to bed.</i>

56
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:23,501
<i>Thursday, I arrived early to sit next to her.</i>

57
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:27,084
<i>No one was there yet,
so I had a cigarette</i>

58
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,709
<i>till the hall filled up.</i>

59
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:33,626
<i>When I came in, I didn't see her at first.</i>

60
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,667
<i>But she was talking to a friend.</i>

61
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:40,751
<i>I sat next to her.
She nodded as if she knew me.</i>

62
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,376
<i>But she went and sat
where she'd left her coat!</i>

63
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:48,292
<i>I didn't dare change seats.</i>

64
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,459
<i>The third time was yesterday.</i>

65
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:55,834
<i>She was carrying home her groceries,</i>

66
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,709
in my neighbourhood!

67
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:00,626
The preliminaries are over. Attack!

68
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:17,667
What has Pierre Schaeffer taught us? A lot.

69
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:22,459
He's dealt musicology a staggering blow.

70
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Clichy's my stop.
Odd I didn't see you sooner.

71
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,917
You go often?

72
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:33,626
Yes, to all the Russian concerts.
Sunday mornings.

73
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,626
Not much fun!

74
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,584
It's a shame,
but we'd have met sooner or later.

75
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,251
Don't I live near you?
I saw you with your shopping.

76
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,626
I live on Lécluse.

77
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,084
What do you do?

78
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,792
I'm a student. And you?

79
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,001
- I'm in records.
- You work?

80
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,084
For Philips.

81
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,459
I'm on my own.

82
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,376
It must be strange to be independent!

83
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,334
That depends, because …

84
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,751
It's my stepfather's car!

85
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:17,084
Going to the Gavoty lecture?

86
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,751
Probably.

87
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:24,292
If not, I'll surely be at the concert
the next night or the night after.

88
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:28,751
Okay, but what's your phone number?
I'll see you again, right?

89
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:32,792
Yes, but call in the evening.
I'm not always in.

90
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,334
It's Carnot 08-32.

91
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,167
Well, I've got work!

92
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,792
Goodnight. See you!

93
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,876
<i>Antoine and Colette met often
and traded books and records.</i>

94
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:50,167
<i>Over lemonades, they discussed stereo,</i>

95
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,834
<i>and walked home
and talked for hours in doorways.</i>

96
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:04,292
<i>To her, he was a pal.
He didn't notice it, or else it pleased him.</i>

97
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:12,792
Friends, this is the second discussion
of experimental music.

98
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,917
After the first one with Pierre Schaeffer,

99
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:19,584
I knew by your attentiveness

100
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:23,126
and from your numerous letters

101
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,917
how interested you were!

102
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,584
- Colette?
<i>- Yes, it's me.</i>

103
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,376
<i>- My head aches!</i>
- Where were you last night? Sick?

104
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,459
<i>I only said "maybe"!
I went to a party with friends.</i>

105
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:01,459
<i>Really crazy people. We had a ball!</i>

106
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:06,501
<i>It was terrific but really crazy at the end.</i>

107
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:10,209
<i>I got home at 5:00 this morning!</i>

108
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,459
Can I see you this afternoon?

109
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:17,751
<i>I might be out. We all said
we'd meet again this afternoon.</i>

110
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,084
Okay, see you later!

111
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,251
<i>Come by if you want.</i>

112
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,542
Is Colette in?

113
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:46,959
- No, why?
- I brought her books back.

114
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:50,417
- I'll take them.
- And this letter, too.

115
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,709
I'll give her everything.

116
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,709
- You're Antoine?
- Yes.

117
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,584
She's mentioned you often. Come in!

118
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,501
- Who is it?
- A friend of Colette's!

119
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,959
- Got a moment?
- I don't want to bother.

120
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,959
It's Antoine!

121
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,084
You're in her class?

122
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:16,501
They met at the youth concerts.
Colette told us!

123
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,251
Antoine works! In records, right?

124
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,084
Yes, for Philips.

125
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,167
Fine!

126
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:28,001
I think young folks
should go to work early in life.

127
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,959
I started at 15 at Labord's Garage.

128
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:32,834
Now I'm the boss!

129
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,667
I never drink.

130
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,501
Education's no help.
Take Victor Hugo!

131
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:42,709
Please! Never mind Victor Hugo!

132
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:48,626
He denounced evil, but didn't cure it.

133
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,292
Right?

134
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,167
Perhaps!

135
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,417
Well, I must go. Excuse me.

136
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,959
Going already? Colette will be sorry.

137
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:05,042
- Me, too!
- You must come to dinner soon!

138
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,459
I'll talk to Colette.

139
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:21,959
<i>Your love letter was well-written,</i>

140
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,834
<i>it shows you're experienced!</i>

141
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:27,251
<i>Will you be at Leroux's tonight?</i>

142
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,501
<i>Thanks for the books.</i>

143
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,709
<i>Mother says you're romantic
because of your hair.</i>

144
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,251
<i>See you tonight. Colette.</i>

145
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,584
- Look who I see!
- Antoine!

146
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,084
Just opposite us!

147
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,751
What's going on?

148
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:53,001
- You live there now?
- Yes.

149
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,959
- Since when?
- This afternoon.

150
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:01,917
Can we come up?

151
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:17,417
He's all settled in!

152
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:29,459
A washbasin! A telephone!

153
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,667
Come look out the window!

154
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:36,167
You can see our two windows!

155
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:38,501
But we get the sun.

156
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:41,751
Are your folks alive?

157
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,959
Yes, but I don't see them often. We fight.

158
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,292
That's a shame!

159
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:50,751
Your mama must miss you!

160
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,167
It's my fault.

161
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,876
At home, I ran away often.

162
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,376
- If only Colette would!
- Don't try me!

163
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,542
A family is …

164
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:06,459
Where is one better off
than with one's family? Anywhere!

165
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:10,334
- Hervé Bazin!
- Yes, in <i>Viper in the Fist!</i>

166
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:14,209
Colette may not look like it, but …

167
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:18,126
- François, pour!
- Incredible!

168
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,459
No respect any more!

169
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,709
<i>Colette's parents liked young people</i>

170
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:47,667
<i>and soon adopted Antoine
and invited him often.</i>

171
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,667
<i>Antoine watched Colette come and go.</i>

172
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:54,251
<i>She treated him as before.</i>

173
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:58,876
<i>His move didn't deepen their friendship.</i>

174
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:08,376
How are you?
What brings you by?

175
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:11,917
I got two seats for Gavoty
on electronic music.

176
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:15,542
No, I have a lot of work this afternoon.

177
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,167
How about a film?

178
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:21,626
I can't. I have an essay
that's due tomorrow.

179
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:26,709
- Can't we talk a while?
- No. Some other time. Bye!

180
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:35,709
What a schmuck!
I'm off to a bad start.

181
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:40,542
I shouldn't be in love with her.
She talks to me like a pal.

182
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,084
When I get serious, she laughs!

183
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:47,876
I wait hours for her till I'm frozen!

184
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,792
Well, I'll tell you about my cousin.

185
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:55,834
She cut her hair like Joan of Arc.
I love her and write to her.

186
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,834
Here's one from her!

187
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,917
Terrific!

188
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:04,167
And the envelope!

189
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,792
I'm in record manufacture now.

190
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:07,417
- Ice cream?
- No, thanks.

191
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,709
It's the first record I made. It's for you!

192
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:13,876
- That's nice!
- It took a long time!

193
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,709
Ice cream, chocolate, sweets
and caramels.

194
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:49,667
<i>The French and Austrians
fought at the Auberon Slalom.</i>

195
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:54,834
<i>Charles Bozon finished
both heats and took second place</i>

196
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,626
<i>in front of Burger.</i>

197
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,834
<i>Adrien Duvillard finished fourth,</i>

198
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:02,209
<i>in front of Leitner
and his Austrian namesake.</i>

199
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,001
<i>The Swiss, Mathis,</i>

200
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,501
<i>who was winning in the first heat,</i>

201
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,834
<i>won the slalom
in two minutes, four seconds.</i>

202
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:19,834
<i>Once again, the Austrian
Zimmermann won the heat</i>

203
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:23,126
<i>and took second place,
which Schranz then stole …</i>

204
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,834
I knocked for five minutes!
Are you deaf?

205
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:50,001
It's dark in here! Are you sick?

206
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:54,292
I wanna set things straight.

207
00:25:56,042 --> 00:26:00,876
All these little games …
I can't stand it!

208
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:03,459
You're an idiot!

209
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:09,167
Sure, it's my fault.
I shouldn't have moved here.

210
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:13,751
I'm gonna move back where I was.

211
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,209
So don't lead me on!

212
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:21,126
- Leave me alone!
- What a bore!

213
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,167
But you're invited to dinner!

214
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,501
I won't go!

215
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,667
Never mind that. Come to dinner.

216
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:37,042
If you change your mind,
we'll eat in 15 minutes.

217
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,251
- Had dinner?
- Yes.

218
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,209
- Sure?
- Yes, thanks.

219
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:14,334
Really? I can make an omelette quickly!

220
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:17,501
I'll have a tangerine.

221
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,501
What's new?

222
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:22,084
Going out tonight?

223
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:25,792
I got two seats for Schwarzhof.
But I don't know.

224
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,376
- Go on!
- I can't!

225
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,459
Why?

226
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:30,709
Never you mind!

227
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:36,459
The Schwarzhof recital's on TV.

228
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,417
Want a plate?

229
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:41,792
No, don't bother.

230
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:46,917
Who is it?

231
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,334
It's a real procession.

232
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:09,126
This is Albert. I told you about him.

233
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,917
- You know Antoine.
- We met once.

234
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,751
I'll get my coat!

235
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,542
A cigarette, please.

236
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:30,501
I'm ready. We're off! So long!

237
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,417
Have a nice evening!

238
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,917
Let's watch that TV programme.

239
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,001
Could I have a light?

240
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:06,459
<i>He has kindly made an exception for us.</i>

241
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,167
<i>He has admitted that …</i>

242
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,126
<i>They fall in love</i>

243
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,959
<i>all over the world!</i>

244
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:32,292
<i>All the youth of the world</i>

245
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:35,751
<i>bite into life</i>

246
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:40,709
<i>as if it were a big apple!</i>

247
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,792
<i>The first kiss!</i>

248
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,376
<i>Hello, sorrow!</i>

249
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:51,917
<i>Take my heart!
Give me your hand!</i>

250
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:58,376
<i>It goes wrong! It goes right!</i>

251
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:02,834
<i>Youth is so fleeting,</i>

252
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:08,126
<i>when two by two they go their way,</i>

253
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:13,001
<i>singing down the highway,
when you're 20 and in love!</i>


1
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,557
Oh, it's you?

2
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,352
- Going that way?
- Over there!

3
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,993
- Too bad!
- That's life!

4
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,190
Hello, Mme Vercel.

5
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,594
Put Julien on!

6
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,190
Your husband's out hunting.
He's not back yet.

7
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,355
Then, you'll do.

8
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,994
Go to my bank
and get me a checkbook.

9
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,875
Mail it to room 813,
Hotel Garibaldi, Nice.

10
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,275
I can't leave now.
I'm alone here.

11
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,789
And I'd need your signature.

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,353
Don't quibble with me!

13
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,030
Remember, last time
the manager turned me down:

14
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,356
he told me to get lost.

15
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,596
What nerve!
I'll tell my husband.

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,314
Go ahead. He's on his way in.

17
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,871
It's Mme Vercel. Hurry.

18
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,592
I hope you can hear her. Sounds
like trumpets in the background.

19
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,360
And your wife's rather
overwrought.

20
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,910
It does sound like trumpets.

21
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,713
Marie-Christine?

22
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,717
Come on, don't be so uptight.

23
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,315
You must stay in Nice?

24
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,871
3 more days?

25
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,915
I'll send it.
But don't be so nasty

26
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,912
to my secretary.

27
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,794
Stop saying "that girl".
Her name's Barbara.

28
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,956
Lost?

29
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,356
If she said that,

30
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,313
you were right.

31
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,271
Why did you insult my wife?

32
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,232
You told her to get lost.

33
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,793
No, I didn't!

34
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,909
She's high-strung,
but she doesn't lie.

35
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,235
Yes, she did!

36
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
She got along well
with my former secretary.

37
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,039
Listen, Mr. Vercel,

38
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,471
why not let your wife pick
your next secretary?

39
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,749
My next one

40
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,678
will start in a month.

41
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,236
"Le Provencal?"

42
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,671
The Want Ads section, please.

43
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,351
I'm looking for
a skilled secretary.

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,195
She has to be fluent in English.

45
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,959
A month from now.

46
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,878
Yes, references required.

47
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,391
Marital status? Irrelevant.

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,036
Get yourself an orphan.
They're used to being abused!

49
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,672
Mr. Vercel, please.

50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,311
Inspector Santelli to see you.

51
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,914
Detective Jambrau.

52
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,318
How was the hunting today?

53
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,272
I didn't hit anything.

54
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,597
I don't know why I bother.
I'm fed up.

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,392
Notice anything unusual?

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,396
No...

57
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,034
I heard two odd shots.

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,431
The second
5 seconds after the first...

59
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,549
as if to kill off a duck.
But there was no duck.

60
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,670
There was no duck

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,118
but there was a hunter
whose head was shattered to bits.

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,191
Massoulier?

63
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,676
- Is he dead?
- How did you know it was him?

64
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,952
I didn't mention his name.

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,634
I recognized his car
as I was leaving. It's odd...

66
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,751
he was a crack shot.

67
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,990
Maybe a suicide.

68
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,350
He wouldn't commit suicide, chief.

69
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,875
His brother's a priest.

70
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,033
It doesn't mean anything.

71
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,949
Do you mind
if I leave early tonight?

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,355
Even if you mind, I don't care.

73
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,836
According to union rules...

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,434
I can take 2 hours off
to look for a new job.

75
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,508
Vercel real estate!

76
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,314
You sound like an angel...

77
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,875
but you killed Massoulier.
You'll pay for it!

78
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,512
It's me again.
It's very rude to hang up.

79
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,517
Hello. Don't hang up again.

80
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,518
No, madame. Wait a minute...

81
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,551
Just let me lower the TV.

82
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,676
Ok, I'm listening.

83
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,030
You're a murderer.
You killed Massoulier

84
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,514
because you were jealous.

85
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,711
He was your wife's lover,

86
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,592
one of many...

87
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,950
Madame, I could sue you.

88
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,673
It was jealousy.

89
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,838
I know all about jealousy.
It's agony.

90
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,913
She slept with anyone
and tutti quanti.

91
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,556
Ask her about the silver dining set
that you got as a wedding present.

92
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,237
Who are you?

93
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,510
If I were you, I'd kill myself.

94
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,512
If she's so virtuous,

95
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,508
ask her what she did
with the silver dining set.

96
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,550
Who are you?

97
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,639
If I were you, I'd kill myself.

98
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,755
"Me hate him?

99
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,308
"Oh no! You're all wrong.

100
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,989
"I've admired him all along.

101
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,709
"He's a head taller
than the others.

102
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,829
"Brave, yet gentle.
Noble and proud. Berard!

103
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,031
"He rides past,
his head unbowed. "

104
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,389
"He is charming. "

105
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,828
"Such a man must be... "

106
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,836
"Refined. "

107
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,600
"His eyes reflect his great heart.

108
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,516
"A great heart!"

109
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,675
"Tremendous!"

110
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,598
- "Gallant!"
- "Brave!"

111
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,279
"And yet, kind!"

112
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,595
"Tender. "

113
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,519
- "Generous!"
- "Wonderful!"

114
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,789
"I like him!"

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,797
"His height is extraordinary!"

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,468
"His brow! His eyes! His nose!"

117
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,479
"If she keeps on praising me,
I'm ruined. "

118
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,878
Not bad.
But if the king isn't funnier...

119
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,798
I'll play the part myself.

120
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,155
Let's go on to Blanche
and the jester, Triboulet.

121
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,998
- Where's Triboulet?
- He's not here.

122
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,633
Bertrand's always late.

123
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,717
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

124
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,797
Well, he's your ex-husband.

125
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,473
Does he know we're rehearsing?

126
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,398
Cut it out!

127
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,434
We've been divorced for a year.
I'm not his custodian.

128
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,073
Why not call his paper?

129
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,272
We're wasting time.
Let's look at the wardrobe.

130
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,799
Hello, Mme Vercel.

131
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,235
You'll wake all the neighbors.

132
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,709
Come on,
it's none of our business.

133
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,950
I know all about jealousy.
It's agony.

134
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,791
She slept with anyone
and tutti quanti.

135
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,115
I admit it.

136
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,913
I was Massoulier's mistress...

137
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,709
but it's ancient history.

138
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,160
He's dead and so what?
He was a bastard

139
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,112
and a lousy lover.

140
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,556
Leave me alone!

141
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,994
I've nothing to say to you.

142
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,919
Open the door.

143
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,069
I'm scared of you.

144
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,998
Don't be ridiculous!

145
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,634
You won't hit me?

146
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,035
Have I ever hit you?

147
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,950
There's no need
for you to be afraid.

148
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,950
You know I never get angry.

149
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,117
I don't understand anger.

150
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,312
I don't understand arguments.

151
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,514
If someone disappoints me,

152
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,199
I lower the iron curtain.

153
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,198
You're reading the paper?

154
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,719
Is it interesting?

155
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,755
I'm speaking calmly...

156
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,553
and regretfully, but I mean it:

157
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,188
We must get a divorce.

158
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,068
Nothing to say?

159
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,159
I don't hear you.
I'm reading the paper.

160
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,196
I'm reading it for you.

161
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,794
Don't talk.

162
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,988
Look at me.

163
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,069
Wait...

164
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,068
Wait awhile.

165
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,236
I'm waiting for you, Julien.

166
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,309
Don't tell them I'm here.

167
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,715
Inspector Santelli
wants to see you.

168
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,956
We met today.

169
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,718
He wants to see you again.

170
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,794
Did you know Massoulier
was going hunting today?

171
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,074
Certainly not.

172
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,236
But you recognized his car.

173
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,034
I told you I saw it
only as I was leaving.

174
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,629
What shot pellets go in this gun?

175
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,909
I'd say three.

176
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,795
Nowadays no one uses six but me.

177
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,034
This is Massoulier's gun:
3 shot pellets.

178
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,716
But Massoulier was killed
by two number six shots.

179
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,031
Is that why I'm here?

180
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,911
No.

181
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,759
It's to show you this.

182
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,639
The 6 shot pellets I bought.
I told you myself I use 6!

183
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,832
You also told me
you were the only one to use 6!

184
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,919
You must be kidding!

185
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,154
Look here Vercel...

186
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,076
I may be younger than you,
but I'm not intimidated!

187
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,917
It's going to be a long night.
Tomorrow too.

188
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,192
Then, I'll call my lawyer.

189
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,030
I can detain you for 48 hours
without a lawyer.

190
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,319
Who is your lawyer?

191
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,748
Mr. Clement.

192
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,795
Go ahead, then.

193
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,836
I won't answer any question
till he gets here.

194
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,029
You won't get a peep out of me...

195
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,231
not even the right time!

196
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,759
Good evening, Mr. Clement.

197
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,075
Bring in two chairs
and some sandwiches.

198
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,436
Massoulier's been killed.

199
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,311
I know.

200
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,069
These idiots suspect me.
They want to detain me.

201
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,269
It's their right, but...

202
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,869
I think I was denounced.

203
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,952
Not exactly, but accused
by a loony anonymous phone caller.

204
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,878
- Did you tell them?
- Not yet.

205
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,992
What do you want here?

206
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,995
One day,
I'll find you in my bedroom.

207
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,031
We'll see this with Mme Santelli.

208
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,229
Listen to me...

209
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,835
You two, come here.

210
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,948
No conspiracies.

211
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,275
Sit down.

212
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,040
- Commissaire Santelli?
- What is it now?

213
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,993
He's an Albanian.
She's his interpreter.

214
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,509
They insisted on seeing you.

215
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,471
I want to live here,
in this country.

216
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,116
I don't want to be sent back.

217
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,635
He wants political asylum here,
Inspector.

218
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,196
Political asylum at 11 p. m.!

219
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,039
I'll see what I can do.

220
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,153
You kept us waiting!

221
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,353
I know, I'm sorry. Killings
don't happen everyday in this town.

222
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,278
Massoulier died this morning.

223
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,711
Neither a suicide nor an accident.

224
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,629
He was hot pointblank
in the head.

225
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,395
They've got a prime suspect.

226
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,517
When they went to get him...

227
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,598
Vercel was about to flee.

228
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,550
Julien Vercel.

229
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,876
- Is he arrested?
- No, detained!

230
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,159
Do you feel better?

231
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,193
Yes, thanks to you.

232
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,239
But why does that cop

233
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,159
go on and on
about being younger than I am?

234
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,958
That's to overcome his timidity.
But he's no fool.

235
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,592
I doubt the killer
is a local resident.

236
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,958
What about those phone calls?

237
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,273
Just another maniac.

238
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,549
Listen Clement,

239
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,829
I'm sure my wife
was Massoulier's mistress.

240
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,717
You've got no proof.

241
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,636
I can't believe it.

242
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,032
It's true.
I'm considering a divorce.

243
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,719
No, not now!

244
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,632
It would look bad.

245
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,877
Have you told your wife?

246
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,715
No, she's in Nice.
She's coming back tomorrow.

247
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,830
Then wait.

248
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,911
You may work things out.

249
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,756
The word "divorce" is ugly.

250
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,513
Both the word and the act!

251
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,076
If things reach that stage...

252
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,917
I'd feel wretched...
really wretched.

253
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,195
Here we are.

254
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,638
Thank you for everything.

255
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,952
Come in for a drink.

256
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,269
No, thanks.

257
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,553
My daughter's feverish.
I want to make sure she's okay.

258
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,679
Don't worry.

259
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,348
Calm down and get some sleep.

260
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,877
"You're so kind, father. "

261
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,749
"Are you not my own flesh
and blood?"

262
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,157
I'm fed up:
Bertrand keeps on pawing me!

263
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,630
Old Hugo didn't mind
a little incest.

264
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,631
"How can we stage out play...
If she won't meet me half way?"

265
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,478
Your attitude isn't professional.

266
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,032
We're not professionals.
We're amateurs!

267
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,992
We play for fun and charity.

268
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,634
Who decided Bertrand
would play Triboulet?

269
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,278
We're wasting time.
Let's start all over.

270
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,788
You come in when you hear:
"Here she comes".

271
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,752
Help me move the door.

272
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,039
I've got to leave town.
Can you manage the agency?

273
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,437
Make up your mind:
you fire me and now I'm promoted.

274
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,756
I'm in trouble.

275
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,672
I can't force you to help me.

276
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,996
What do you want me to do?

277
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,593
I'll explain.

278
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,110
"Heavens,
I'm terribly impatient.

279
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,155
"But I hear her footsteps.
Here she comes. "

280
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,399
"Two bells chime. "

281
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,992
"Heavens,
I'm terribly impatient.

282
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,839
"But I hear her footsteps.
Here she comes. "

283
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,433
Put the lights out.

284
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,313
What's wrong?
The police let you go.

285
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,312
Only because they had to.

286
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,953
I must go to Nice...

287
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,755
to find out what
my wife was doing there.

288
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,673
To find out...

289
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,519
whom she was meeting,
everything.

290
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,550
If there was someone
besides Massoulier.

291
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,792
I must tell you something:

292
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,435
Massoulier was my wife's lover!

293
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,914
I know it,

294
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,149
but it's none of my business.

295
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,479
Where's the gun that was here?

296
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,795
In my pocket.

297
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,796
Oh, no!

298
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,798
It's crazy for you to run away,

299
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,358
but if it's to kill your wife,
I won't let you.

300
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,751
I'm not going to kill her...
she's already dead!

301
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,710
What?

302
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,629
She was killed
in our house this evening...

303
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,953
but I didn't do it.

304
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,389
Do you believe me?

305
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,513
It's hard to believe...

306
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,552
She came home at 7 p. m.

307
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,032
We had a big fight.
Then, this fool,

308
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,755
Santelli's assistant,
took me back to the police station.

309
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,639
I was very upset

310
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,717
but they allowed my lawyer
to come over.

311
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,150
He drove me home.

312
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,796
When he asked when my wife
was coming back, I lied...

313
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,911
and said she'd be back in 2 days.

314
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,630
Because of that stupid lie,
I couldn't ask him to help me.

315
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,839
My daughter's feverish.
I want to make sure she's okay.

316
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,549
Don't worry.

317
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,956
Calm down and get some sleep.

318
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,593
Do you believe me now?

319
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,313
- Would the cops believe me?
- No.

320
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,909
I have no choice.

321
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,759
I must dig
into Marie-Christine's past.

322
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,629
I must investigate in Nice
where she ran a beauty salon.

323
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,239
I've got to run.

324
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,034
No, you can't drive
in your condition.

325
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,073
I'll make you some coffee
or you'll fall asleep.

326
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,590
I'm much too keyed up
to fall asleep at the wheel.

327
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,316
Let me give you my opinion.

328
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,513
I think you should turn yourself in
as a temporary prisoner.

329
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,477
"A temporary prisoner!"

330
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,074
And I'll go to Nice

331
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,117
to investigate for you.

332
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,832
I know Nice very well.

333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,036
I went to business school there.

334
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,431
It was the best school

335
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,276
for the Prevost-Delaunay system.
It was on Plaza Albert Ist.

336
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,674
I guess that's not very exciting.

337
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,474
Here's the coffee.

338
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,111
Damn it!

339
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,830
POLICE STATION

340
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,592
Is "rue des Entrepreneurs"
on the way?

341
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,400
To the Garibaldi? It's not far.

342
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,154
Then, let's go:
57, rue des Entrepreneurs.

343
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,957
It's a nightclub!

344
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,470
It wasn't a beauty salon?

345
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,352
It's been
the "Red Angel" for years.

346
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,597
If I were you,
I wouldn't set foot in there.

347
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,035
What do you mean?

348
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,152
You may not believe me,
but if you come in,

349
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,191
I won't wait for you.
It's Louison's joint.

350
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,751
- Who is she?
- I don't know...

351
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,713
but I don't want trouble.

352
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,471
Make up your mind:
You stay

353
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,159
or we go on but I'm leaving.

354
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,438
Okay, on to the Garibaldi.

355
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,959
A room for the night.

356
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,639
Have you reserved?

357
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,116
Mme Vercel recommended
her room to me.

358
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,230
Mme Vercel.

359
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,115
She was in room 813,
but it isn't ready.

360
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,590
You can have room 811, next door.

361
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,596
Fine.

362
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,273
Where's your luggage?

363
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,959
It'll be here tomorrow.

364
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,434
But you wanted a room
for one night.

365
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,589
Yes. My luggage will get here
in time for my departure.

366
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,079
Just a minute, please.

367
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,997
Shall I pay in advance?

368
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,713
No, it's alright.

369
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,875
Germaine!

370
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,476
Come here!

371
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,472
You must help me out.

372
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,556
Right now?

373
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,278
It's embarrassing.

374
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,319
Don't tell anybody:

375
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,238
My trick can only make it...

376
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,669
if I'm a maid.

377
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,472
Is he the tax man?

378
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,752
So you must lend me your apron.

379
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,991
- What about me?
- I'll give it back.

380
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,760
Leave it on my shelf when you go.

381
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,197
May I help?

382
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,151
I need a savonette.

383
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,511
No problem. Just ask.

384
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,999
I've got a hunch
you know you way around. Right?

385
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,313
Tell me about her.

386
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,870
I never saw this dame before.

387
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,630
The woman in the panther coat...
She was here this morning.

388
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,398
Was she alone?

389
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,556
Yes, always by herself.

390
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,590
No visitors?

391
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,994
Never...

392
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,519
I bet I know:

393
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,951
The man with her
is your husband, right?

394
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,753
No, he's my brother.

395
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,112
Since room 813 is ready,
can I stay here?

396
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,272
It's alright with me.

397
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,868
I'll just tell the desk.

398
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,389
What's going on?

399
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,037
It's a mistake.

400
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,998
I'm in the wrong room.

401
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,676
I won't let you leave!

402
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,239
Don't run away!

403
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,312
- Who are you?
- Let me go!

404
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,149
Who are you?

405
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,192
What did you do in my room?

406
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,351
LABLACHE DETECTIVE AGENCY

407
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,435
I was wrong to let Vercel go.

408
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,710
I should have kept him here.

409
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,958
But you were with him.

410
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,799
I left him at his house.

411
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,799
He didn't tell me

412
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,189
his wife was back.

413
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,354
I'm sure
he can explain everything.

414
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,278
Chief, a call from Nice.

415
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,274
Nice airport.

416
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,915
Nice airport.
Stop your search.

417
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,190
We've located his car.

418
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,674
He's flown the coop!

419
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,551
Good morning.
Mr. Lablache, please.

420
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,433
He's in conference.

421
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,312
Remember, gentlemen:
Our job is 10% inspiration

422
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,273
and 90% transpiration.

423
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,435
Mr. Lablache?

424
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,433
Let me show you something.

425
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,834
It's the woman I told you about.

426
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,117
Leave us alone.

427
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,074
Put this on.

428
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,399
They won't recognize you.

429
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,279
I'll be frank with you,
I get the picture.

430
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,712
I know about
the incident last night.

431
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,031
The man is a beginner here.

432
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,357
He's not good at shadowing jobs
so we gave him an investigation.

433
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,629
End of story.

434
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,672
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

435
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,429
We both know
that private detectives

436
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,756
have no right to break and enter.

437
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,350
If I report this to the police,
you'll be in trouble.

438
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,558
I have a hunch
you won't go to the police.

439
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,836
Don't bet on it!

440
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,110
Normally, 9 persons out of 10

441
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,436
would have complained
to the hotel management.

442
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,518
But you came straight here.

443
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,990
What do you want?
My apologies?

444
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,794
I apologize most sincerely.

445
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,432
I direct the most
reputable agency in Nice.

446
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,598
A client requested
a report on a woman.

447
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,475
Yesterday, she was
in room 813 at the Garibaldi.

448
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,513
We didn't know
she'd checked out.

449
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,551
I accept your apologies...

450
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,076
but I want to know
the name of your client.

451
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,316
Even if I knew it. No way!

452
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,512
But in this case,
he didn't give his name.

453
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,836
He calls us when he wants news.

454
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,759
Do you think it was one
of her lovers?

455
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,635
In the past 25 years,
I've learned one thing:

456
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,674
It's never the lover who has
a woman shadowed, it's her husband!

457
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,189
In that case,
tell me her name...

458
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,960
the name of the woman
in room 813.

459
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,674
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

460
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,037
It's Marie-Christine Vercel.

461
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,591
Now, you've got to help me.

462
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,793
The bus to Marseilles?

463
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,513
Across the way!

464
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,952
"Le Capitaine" is ahead,

465
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,191
"Mon amour" a length behind.

466
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,957
"Mon Amour", moves up to
the finish line

467
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,156
and wins by a nose.

468
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,719
Do you remember
"Le Capitaine"?

469
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,911
Mme Vercel's lover?
Her "Amour?"

470
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,750
No, "Le Capitaine" isn't a man,
he's a horse...

471
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,156
Same thing for "Mon Amour. "

472
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,349
Horse racing!

473
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,598
That's where all her money went.
Here's my bus.

474
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,071
Check into the racing circles!

475
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,555
How dirty!

476
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,469
Don't you realize?

477
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,957
I'm locked in here,

478
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,509
gagged out,

479
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,510
with the phone ringing all day...

480
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,676
and wild rumors spreading
in town.

481
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,990
You meant well
and were trying to help

482
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,714
but it was up to me
to go to Nice.

483
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,194
Helpful or not...

484
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,910
I wouldn't have lifted a finger

485
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,793
if I'd known you were a killer.

486
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,319
What do you mean?

487
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,669
I know now!

488
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,314
3 days ago, you asked a detective
in Nice to shadow your wife.

489
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,399
I never left town.

490
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,275
You did it by phone
and didn't tell them your name.

491
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,716
You were suspicious of her.

492
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,791
I might as well tell you:

493
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,113
I always knew you were guilty,
but I went along with you

494
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,719
because I thought it was
an unpremeditated crime of passion.

495
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,753
In reality,
you planned the whole thing

496
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,116
and I find it revolting.

497
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,433
No Barbara, you're right.

498
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,591
You're entitled to the truth.

499
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,109
I'm guilty.

500
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,675
I'm guilty...

501
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,793
just as you said.

502
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,880
But please try to understand me.

503
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,676
You mustn't think I'm a coward.

504
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,036
I'm ready to pay for what I did.

505
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,596
Let's go to the cops.
We'll tell them everything.

506
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,272
You're right, Barbara,

507
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,114
about the man
who wanted her watched.

508
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,960
When we find him,
we'll have the killer.

509
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,596
What's that?

510
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,468
Be careful, Barbara.

511
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,199
What do you want?

512
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,349
I'm just doing my job.

513
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,959
No stray dogs here!

514
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,110
No dogs...

515
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,713
but lots of dead bodies.

516
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,512
You're not fussy, are you?

517
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,398
Working for a killer.

518
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,272
I feel concerned.

519
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,152
I'm worried.

520
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,231
Do you have a picture
of your boss?

521
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,592
Is that all?
Draw it yourself!

522
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,189
Go on, get lost!

523
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,715
Everybody knows
you sleep with him.

524
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,755
You creep!

525
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,359
The coffee's warm.

526
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,713
It's hot, right?

527
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,399
Yes, very.

528
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,668
Is it too hot?

529
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,199
No, it's better when it's hot.

530
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,393
I'll pick it up there.
You listen in.

531
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,479
We'll lift the receiver together.

532
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,159
After the next ring.

533
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,190
Vercel Agency.

534
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,392
So it's true?
I can hardly believe it.

535
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,749
Who is this?

536
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,949
You tramp...

537
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,678
working for a killer.

538
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,911
I didn't know
he'd been indicted.

539
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,712
Don't be a smart ass!

540
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,759
I'm sure you know
where he's hiding.

541
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,599
Why don't you join him, you slut?

542
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,792
You think it's the same woman?

543
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,112
I think I know her. Don't you?

544
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,032
I've no idea.

545
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,709
Watch out!

546
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,678
I'd like to see Mr. Vercel.

547
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,110
He's not here. Can I help you?

548
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,189
I wanted to talk
to him about a chateau.

549
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:24,711
A chateau...

550
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,832
for a summer camp.

551
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,072
Do you want to rent it, or buy it?

552
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,949
Perhaps an annuity purchase.

553
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,115
It's risky...

554
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,880
You must wait
till the owners are deceased.

555
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,913
But our camp's only open
3 months a year.

556
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,037
Even so,
you can't evict the owners.

557
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,793
They're generally elderly.

558
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,231
My vacation camp
is for adolescents.

559
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,998
It's rarely for senior citizens!

560
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,238
Think it over.

561
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,915
I'd like to get going

562
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,157
by next year.
Kids need a bracing climate,

563
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,719
something high up.

564
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,630
We have some nice properties,
between 900 and 1800 feet up.

565
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,791
The ads say
"a step from the ocean. "

566
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,759
Do you want the mountains
or the beach?

567
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,439
You seem a little confused.

568
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,039
Isn't this Mr. Vercel's agency?

569
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,433
Can't I speak to him?

570
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,717
He's away at a convention...

571
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,559
the real estate convention.

572
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,197
You deal in real estate?

573
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,991
Does this look like
a grocery store?

574
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,192
I've got work to do.

575
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,869
Why don't you think things over.

576
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,831
Come back some other time.

577
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,632
Alright, I'll be back.

578
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,193
I'll surely be back.

579
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,631
If all our customers
were like that one...

580
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,875
What a creep!

581
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,795
A telex.

582
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,998
"Report from Lablache to Vercel.

583
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,233
"Marie-Christine Beauty Salon

"Signed: Lablache. "

592
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,156
Take it to Clement,
but don't tell him I'm here.

593
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,271
Why worry about him?

594
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,516
After all, he's your lawyer.

595
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,035
Give me my raincoat.

596
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,038
Just look!

597
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,798
Can I run around this way?

598
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,468
Now, I'll lock up and remember:

599
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,352
don't answer the phone.

600
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,834
Unless you call.

601
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,673
How will you know?

602
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,639
We'll make up a code:

603
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,951
let it ring once and hang up.

604
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,515
When you ring again,
I'll answer.

605
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,073
Good idea. So long.

606
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,553
Mr. Clement, please.

607
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,796
He's busy. Would you wait?

608
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,833
There's someone in.

609
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,594
Have a seat.

610
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,874
It won't be long.

611
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,232
If you won't...

612
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,993
I'll go to the police!

613
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,878
It's a scandal!

614
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,634
They were all jealous of him!

615
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,158
My life is over now!

616
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,192
It's all over!

617
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,917
I meant to call you. Come in.

618
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,832
My life is over!

619
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,359
Take a deep breath.

620
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,749
It's awful:

621
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,550
The more you love a person,

622
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,318
the less helpful you are.

623
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,476
Wasn't Mr. Vercel with you
that night?

624
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,319
I drove him home
from the police station.

625
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,073
And you know,

626
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,909
I wanted to ask him
to stay at my house...

627
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,715
but I was embarrassed to.

628
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,148
I didn't.

629
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,635
But Mme Vercel was already dead!

630
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,989
Who knows?

631
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,670
He told me she was still in Nice...

632
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,039
and yet the police officer
saw her suitcase...

633
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,798
one hour earlier in the salon.

634
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,878
Why did Julien lie?

635
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,916
You talk as if he was guilty.
Do you believe that?

636
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,680
No, but to believe
or not to believe

637
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,469
is not the question.
Life isn't a novel.

638
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,869
In a novel,
our friend would be guilty.

639
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,950
By running away, Vercel is acting
as if he were guilty.

640
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,071
What would you do in his place?

641
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,511
If he asked me,
I'd tell him what I'm telling you.

642
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,392
No reason to worry.

643
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,990
Thank God,
we're in France where juries

644
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,796
allow for crimes of passion.

645
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,913
Meanwhile, tell me...

646
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,878
what can I do for you?

647
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,271
I want your advice.

648
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,110
If you know where Vercel is,

649
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,151
can you ask him...

650
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,588
for instructions.

651
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,156
I've kept the agency open
but is that what he wants?

652
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,236
Unfortunately...

653
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,232
I don't know where he is.

654
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,876
If I did,
I'd tell him to surrender.

655
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,789
Only then can I really help him.

656
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,790
If he contacts you, tell him that

657
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,833
and ask him to call me at once.

658
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,549
Come along, please.

659
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,875
What for?

660
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,877
The chief wants to see you.

661
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,478
What were you doing
in Nice last night?

662
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,238
None of your business!

663
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,714
Is that so?

664
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,679
I already know
that at the Garibaldi,

665
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,269
you insisted on having room 813,

666
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,189
the very one Mme Vercel
had just vacated.

667
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,433
Mr. Vercel...

668
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,475
asked me for some information

669
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,671
on his wife's trip to Nice.

670
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,189
But we both thought she was alive.

671
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,597
At least, I thought so.
But never mind.

672
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,473
I gather you also know
that 3 days ago,

673
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,955
the Lablache agency
got instructions

674
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,957
to check Mme Vercel's past.

675
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,470
When you're about to kill someone,
you don't consult a private eye.

676
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,315
Why not try to find out

677
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,590
who called the agency in Nice?

678
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,316
I'd be on top of things...

679
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,874
if I'd kept your boss locked up.

680
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,550
I had the right to detain him.

681
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,395
Don't leave town

682
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,914
without my permission.

683
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,157
We're in charge.
And if your murdering boss...

684
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,469
He's innocent!

685
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,438
You're really stubborn!

686
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,633
How can I convince you we're dealing
with a dangerous paranoid?

687
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,758
Impressive, aren't they?

688
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,234
Mme Vercel...

689
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,279
Massoulier's car as we found it.

690
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,553
Look at the door.

691
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,718
Now see these fingerprints,

692
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,992
the fingers of Vercel's right hand.

693
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,114
It's very simple.

694
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,677
As I was leaving,
I saw a car with the lights on.

695
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,031
To be helpful, I put them out
and closed the door

696
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,673
with my hand like this.

697
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,271
It would be a miracle
if I'd left no prints!

698
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,794
Did you tell them that?

699
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,558
I couldn't... I didn't know.

700
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,877
When Santelli showed me
the pictures, I was upset.

701
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,479
Because you're a ninny!

702
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,593
Besides, why go to the cops?
I told you to see my lawyer.

703
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,358
You're all mixed up.

704
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,596
You keep on getting me in deeper.

705
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,114
I'm going to call my lawyer.

706
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,149
Let me tell you something first.

707
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,636
Your dear lawyer thinks
you're guilty.

708
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,115
Did he say so?

709
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,914
He almost did.
True, he adores you.

710
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,149
"My best friend...
my close friend... "

711
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,558
But what he really craves

712
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,158
is a chance to display his eloquence
by pleading a crime of passion.

713
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,920
He said:
"The French adore love affairs...

714
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,197
"I'll get Julien Vercel acquitted. "

715
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,349
You still want to call him?

716
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,430
Look!

717
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,835
Between your lawyer...

718
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,799
and Santelli:
The creep who came here.

719
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,633
The summer camp?

720
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,750
I'm sure of it.

721
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,269
He's snooping around.

722
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,233
First, he's there
when they remove the body.

723
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,635
Then, he just happens
to drop in here.

724
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,758
It's not a coincidence.

725
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,315
Stop scratching your ear:
it's annoying.

726
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,831
But it helps me to think.

727
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,077
Dial the number
of the Eden Cinema.

728
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,799
You want to see a movie?

729
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,514
No, I want to speak
to the manager.

730
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,280
Massoulier owned it,
so she may know something.

731
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,438
She might know
whom he spoke to last.

732
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,954
The Eden: Next show at 8:30.

733
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,349
Good morning,

734
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,916
I'd like to speak to the manager.

735
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,519
There is no manager.

736
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,074
Do you know this voice?

737
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,270
I'm not sure.

738
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,631
She's the nut
who makes those phone calls.

739
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,558
To be sure...

740
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,593
I'll call back and keep her talking.

741
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,358
I just want to know...

742
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,869
if "Paths of Glory"
is a love story.

743
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,069
It's a war film

744
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,834
between the French and Germans.

745
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,995
Canons and soldiers.
Are there any women?

746
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,230
The soldiers carry photos
of their wives...

747
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,995
So, it's a love story?

748
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,435
There's love, battles, songs,

749
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,272
emotions and tutti quanti.

750
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,674
Orchestra or balcony?

751
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,918
It's about Mr. Massoulier.

752
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,838
The film is half over

753
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,069
but it's up to you.

754
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,396
Do you know who he met last?

755
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,234
I know who sent you.

756
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,148
If he had any decency,
he would kill himself.

757
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,870
You're all wrong.
Mr. Vercel isn't guilty.

758
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,237
Don't be indecent!

759
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,517
He wasn't the only one.

760
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,515
Many men were drooling
around that bitch.

761
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,996
It turned ugly
when that slut hit town.

762
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,191
Yes, she was a slut!

763
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,715
Go away!

764
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,194
Listen to me!

765
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,040
I too want to know the truth.

766
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,673
Go away!

767
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,992
Either go in, or go out.

768
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,596
I'm just looking at the posters.

769
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,910
This is the lobby...

770
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,276
you're in the way.

771
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,069
I'm asking you to leave.

772
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,839
- How much?
- What?

773
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,234
How much is it?

774
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,279
It's past 7:35. P.m.

775
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,114
So, you saw Barbara?

776
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,197
I couldn't get a word out of her,

777
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,630
but I'm sure she knows a lot:

778
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,958
I saw her
leaving the lawyer's office.

779
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,634
She was hysterical.

780
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,794
She just went into a brand new
cabaret, "The Red Angel. "

781
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,319
I thought that was in Nice.

782
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,870
It's the same name.
I could hardly believe my eyes.

783
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,152
There's a restaurant name...

784
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,317
- "Thi Loan. "
- A Vietnamese?

785
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,634
We sold the property,

786
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,869
it's in our files.

787
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,993
She just came out.

788
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,753
What's her name?

789
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,474
I can't just walk up
and ask her name.

790
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,031
She's leaving. I'll follow her.

791
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,675
Barbara, wait. Be careful!

792
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,913
You're late, sir.

793
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,194
You're late and you're losing
your keys.

794
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,316
Has the rehearsal started?

795
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,112
Are we friends again?

796
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,231
You're a lunatic!

797
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,000
Why? Because I want
to sleep with you?

798
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,316
Do divorced couples make love?

799
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,112
It happens every day.

800
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,435
What about Genevieve?

801
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,234
She left me because of you.

802
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,560
I said your name
when I slept with her.

803
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,958
Yes, I know,
while you work like angels,

804
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,350
I miss one rehearsal out of two
and we play

805
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,397
next Sunday.
I've let you down.

806
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,518
So, either you trust me
to be letter perfect...

807
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,039
or else, replace me...

808
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,673
Is this alright?

809
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,312
You've got some nerve!

810
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,678
No, she looks just fine.

811
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,910
Very pretty.

812
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,477
Go on!

813
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,359
Don't mind me.

814
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,754
Go ahead.

815
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,315
"Me hate him? Oh no!

816
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,272
"you're all wrong.

817
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,797
"I've admired him all along. "

818
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,439
"Berard! He rides past,
his head unbowed. "

819
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,518
I'll run along.
I don't want to intrude.

820
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,469
"You obviously prefer
"Le Provencal"...

821
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,638
"To our amateur efforts
at rehearsal. "

822
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,635
I know the cashier's name:
It's Paula Delbeque.

823
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,513
That's a big help.

824
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,319
What about the "Red Angel" file?

825
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,112
Nothing of interest.

826
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,710
"Mme Loan sold
all of her restaurant stock...

827
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,595
"as follows:
365 shares to Paula Delbeque... "

828
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,516
Look!

829
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,472
Delbeque!
It's the same name.

830
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,029
I can't figure it out.

831
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,873
Why would the major stockholder
of a nightclub...

832
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,197
work as a cashier
in a crummy cinema?

833
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,631
It's vital that I talk to her.

834
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,068
Don't be crazy!

835
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,999
All the cops have your picture.
Let me go!

836
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,636
You can't handle it.
Besides, she knows you.

837
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,515
She won't see me.
I'll sneak into her flat.

838
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,551
If they used her as a cover,

839
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,070
she's got files. I'll find them.

840
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,077
Don't you think I can?

841
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,192
Cut it out?
Who is accused of murder?

842
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,630
I get all the dirty work and...

843
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,637
Stop yelling!

844
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,074
Who can that be?

845
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,119
Don't answer it.

846
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,913
I won't. I've got to leave.

847
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,033
You're stubborn, but so am I.

848
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,395
We're both whispering since
the phone rang.

849
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,511
I borrowed
"Le Provencal" car.

850
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,358
It's final: I'm telling you...

851
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,677
What? That I'm fired?
That's already done.

852
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,673
Don't be afraid, it's me.

853
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,792
If this is risky,
I should be in on it, right?

854
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,439
It's really unfair:

855
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,837
if a boss can fire me,
why can't I fire him?

856
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,952
Keep out of sight.

857
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,797
We're at the Eden.

858
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:50,796
I'm slowing down.

859
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,595
Do you recognize the cashier?

860
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,074
I certainly do.

861
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,556
She was Massoulier's mistress
long ago. It didn't last.

862
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,276
I assure you she still loves him.

863
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,917
She's stuck there
between the two evening shows.

864
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,189
One hour to search her apartment,
that's enough to find something.

865
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,831
It's there, on the 4th floor.

866
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,948
I'll go up and you watch.

867
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,752
No way!
I'll go and you watch!

868
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,075
Don't argue.

869
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,474
As you like.

870
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,437
What are you doing here?

871
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,473
I didn't kill him?

872
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,068
He's not dead?

873
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,755
He's breathing.

874
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,358
If we don't stop him,
he'll come to real fast.

875
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,552
We must do something.

876
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:02,996
You know...

877
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,952
this guy...
I'm certain he's the killer.

878
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,355
Not necessarily.

879
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,032
I'm positive, it's him.

880
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,988
I'd say there are
9 chances out of 10.

881
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,031
Tying up an unconscious man
isn't very heroic.

882
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,157
We're no heroes!

883
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,116
The police?

884
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,913
How about some protection?

885
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,674
Robberies night after night!

886
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,552
57, rue des Recollets,

887
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,869
there's a customer for you.

888
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,836
What did you do that for?

889
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,679
To accelerate your release.

890
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,548
What are you waiting for?

891
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,917
Can you start it?

892
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,391
I'll handle it.

893
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,597
Look, it's flooded.

894
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,752
What got into you?

895
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,038
I saw it in a movie.

896
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,630
Let's wait to see how it winds up.

897
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,831
We'll find out
in the morning paper.

898
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,752
I feel dizzy.

899
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,550
You're O.K.?

900
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,320
It's the first time
I slugged a man.

901
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,556
By the twelfth,
I'll have the knack.

902
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,838
With all what's happened
in the past two days...

903
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,555
it's only now I realize
that Marie-Christine's gone.

904
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,909
I lived with a stranger
for 2 years.

905
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,076
I sensed there was something
wrong, but I ignored it.

906
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,993
I wonder why she came here.

907
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,114
- Was she your client at first?
- No, I found the store for her.

908
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,990
She closed her beauty salon
soon after opening it.

909
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,190
She claimed she wanted
to be with me.

910
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,470
I liked her, I really did...

911
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,759
you can't understand.

912
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,236
In that case,
why tell me about it?

913
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,191
Death is a strange thing.

914
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,838
When people die of illness...

915
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,192
it's cruel and unfair,
but it's really death.

916
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,796
When it's a crime,
or a killing...

917
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,750
death becomes abstract...

918
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,598
as if the solution
to the mystery had priority.

919
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,270
It's like reading a thriller.

920
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,795
And yet Marie-Christine is dead...

921
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,118
and so is Massoulier.

922
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,633
From here, our town looks lovely.

923
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,031
When I started in business,

924
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,834
whenever a customer hesitated...
I'd bring him here

925
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,399
to convince him.

926
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,071
Behind those little lights,
there are all sorts of people:

927
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,157
watching TV, night shifts,

928
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,873
sleeping children...

929
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,873
and our killer,

930
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,273
who'll be sore as hell
when the cops pick him up.

931
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,719
No, let me drive.

932
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,159
Why did you kiss me?

933
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,918
There are no cops around.

934
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,315
Who knows!

935
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,794
Another riddle.

936
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,118
Just browsing?

937
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,154
I'll pay, but it's not worth it.

938
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,315
What do they say?

939
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,873
Almost nothing.

940
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,948
"Inquest in double murder
at a standstill. "

941
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,229
It's awful!

942
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,714
We didn't dream it.

943
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,278
There's another possibility:

944
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,311
the guy we slugged is a big shot

945
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,512
and the cops want
the whole network.

946
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:17,996
What's that?

947
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,792
It's for Massoulier's funeral.

948
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,238
For today?
You've got to go, Barbara.

949
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,194
We can't afford to neglect a lead.

950
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,719
Not this!
I won't stand it!

951
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,509
Take that wreath away!

952
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,034
We are gathered

953
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,714
to accompany Jacques Massoulier

954
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,154
to his last home.

955
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,630
The mass for his eternal soul
will be offered

956
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,274
by his brother,
Father Claude Massoulier.

957
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,398
"May the peace of Our Lord

958
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,757
be with one and all

959
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,638
forever and ever. "

960
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,719
I wonder who invented you!

961
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,152
Who said the priest looked
like a killer?

962
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,274
He was investigating on his own.
It was his right.

963
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,712
We're doing the same thing!

964
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,319
I was wrong to go by looks.

965
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,551
To go by looks!

966
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,957
Even while I was fighting him,

967
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,594
I thought he looked like
a nice guy!

968
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,591
Naturally,
with your imagination...

969
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,633
you figure the real killer
looks like a priest.

970
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,278
I'm here for the secretarial job.
The ad in "Le Provencal".

971
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,475
Oh, the ad! Well,
things have happened since then.

972
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,396
You got someone?

973
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,352
No, the job is open.

974
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,033
Well, it should be.

975
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,511
May I see the director?

976
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,234
Mr. Vercel is out of town.

977
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,995
For how long?

978
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,435
Don't you read the papers?

979
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,798
No, the ink smears.
I hate dirty fingers.

980
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,595
Are you a secretary?

981
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,233
I do what I'm told.

982
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,158
You take stenography?

983
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,551
Those pencil notes?

984
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,750
Is it really necessary?

985
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,471
It comes in handy.
Can you type?

986
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,190
How fast?

987
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,119
I type, but I'm no speed demon.

988
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,195
I type with one finger.

989
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,753
Only one finger?

990
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:29,872
This one.

991
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,116
It's enough.

992
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,594
Let me show you.

993
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,549
Fantastic!

994
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,395
And you're a blonde.

995
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,908
Yes, I am. So what?

996
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,314
It's an asset.

997
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,959
Mr. Vercel hates brunettes.

998
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,559
In fact, he fired me.

999
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,673
I'm leaving.

1000
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,595
Maybe he has other reasons.

1001
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,671
He may want
to rejuvenate his staff!

1002
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,636
Thanks, I feel better.

1003
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,916
It's a pity Mr. Vercel's away.

1004
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,998
He'd be very interested in you.

1005
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,077
I'll leave you my phone number.

1006
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,474
He can call me.

1007
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,114
Almost 4 p. m.
I've got to run.

1008
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,230
A bill, another one...

1009
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,079
publicity... Ah!

1010
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,156
What is it?

1011
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,193
Nothing. An anonymous letter.

1012
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,230
Let's see.

1013
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,431
- It's for me.
- I want to see it.

1014
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,875
"You little intriguer, why don't
you mind your own business?"

1015
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,437
See, "little intriguer".

1016
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,471
When I say it,
you don't believe me.

1017
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,552
We're not getting anywhere.

1018
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,757
All we've done in 3 days
is to bash a priest...

1019
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,678
and to get anonymous filth.

1020
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,871
Do you want to turn yourself in?

1021
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,355
Never! I'd rather die.

1022
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,550
But we've got no more leads.

1023
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,557
I've got a lead.

1024
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,751
It's the "Red Angel. "

1025
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:20,756
First...

1026
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,155
The Eden is
a crummy movie house

1027
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,920
that conceals a chain of cabarets.

1028
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,397
Second...

1029
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,509
The cabarets conceal
a prostitution ring.

1030
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,470
When a hooker

1031
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:38,589
is arrested,
she's released within the hour.

1032
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,794
Because her working card says

1033
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,195
she's a hostess
for "The Red Angel. "

1034
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,076
Thanks to Louison...

1035
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,793
I'll bore from within.

1036
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,592
What does Louison do?

1037
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,189
The oldest profession in the world.

1038
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:54,997
You know her?

1039
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,475
Almost.

1040
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,557
But thanks to her...

1041
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,990
we'll find out what
Paula Delbeque won't tell us.

1042
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,793
Do I look plausible?

1043
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,116
Plausible as what?

1044
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,076
That's all I wanted to know.

1045
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,508
Got a light?

1046
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,951
Do you wear pantyhose?

1047
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,110
No, stockings.

1048
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,753
Then, let's go up.

1049
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,188
No way!

1050
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,356
Why not?

1051
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,632
It's your mustache.
I can't stand it.

1052
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,319
Try another girl.

1053
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,036
Who is she?

1054
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,593
She turned me down.

1055
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,710
Hear that?

1056
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,957
The new one picks her johns.

1057
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,999
I'll handle her.

1058
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,833
This is our beat.

1059
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,076
Louison told me to work here.

1060
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,915
Let's find out.

1061
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,838
Right, let's go ask Louison.

1062
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,268
Let's go.

1063
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,556
What do you plan to do
about the lights?

1064
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,711
You getting cold feet?

1065
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,752
Because customers...

1066
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,274
Excuse me.

1067
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,432
What are you doing here?

1068
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,400
You're not supposed
to come inside.

1069
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,717
There's a mix-up.
She says you hired her.

1070
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,275
We'd never hire a brunette.

1071
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,358
They don't make enough
to buy new shoes.

1072
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,676
She says Louison hired her.

1073
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,995
You know Louison?

1074
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,633
Yes, I know her.

1075
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,716
You know her?

1076
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,831
I know her and she knows me.

1077
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,519
Where did you meet?

1078
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,914
In Nice. I worked there.

1079
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,749
She suggested I come...
and work for her here.

1080
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,394
Louison said that?

1081
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,919
Yes, she did.

1082
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,637
Louison, a visitor!

1083
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,233
What is it?

1084
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,235
This broad says you hired her.

1085
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,433
Have we met?

1086
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,873
I didn't hire her.

1087
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,593
I don't know you.

1088
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,155
And she thought
you were a dame.

1089
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,872
Me, a dame?

1090
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,835
I've been called

1091
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,156
lots of things, but till now...

1092
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,874
no one's ever called me a dame!

1093
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,195
The things you hear...

1094
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,040
"DELBEQUE-MASSOULIER, INC."

1095
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,549
Do you have a cigarette?
A light?

1096
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,150
You want me to puff it for you?
Beat it!

1097
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,315
Wait till we're alone.

1098
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,953
Hey, you!

1099
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,516
You can't hang around here.

1100
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,199
On your way!

1101
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,995
Go on to Marseilles.
There's lots of work there.

1102
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,069
...And the platform goes down.

1103
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,316
The platform goes down
and the girls up!

1104
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,879
You feel better?
No hard feelings?

1105
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,559
No, you were right.

1106
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,398
I was wrong.

1107
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:24,038
But I'm scarred...
so I only get 100 Frs.

1108
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,672
That's less income...

1109
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,077
so you'll have to work more.

1110
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,039
Thank you.
But I've got no right to accept it.

1111
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,312
Since when are you so virtuous?

1112
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,949
Get me Louison.

1113
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,276
I'll get my brother.

1114
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:03,955
It's Paula!

1115
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,275
Coming.

1116
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,192
He's coming to see you.

1117
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,628
No kidding!

1118
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,836
Are you sure?

1119
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,075
Yes.

1120
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,355
Let me take this call upstairs.
Hold on.

1121
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,515
OK.

1122
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,434
I've got the letters.
He'll have to pay.

1123
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,797
- What will you do?
- Don't worry,

1124
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,195
I won't mention you.

1125
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,597
It'll soon be over.

1126
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,432
Oh, it's you? Come in.

1127
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,634
They were well hidden.

1128
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,673
I looked all over.

1129
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,199
You can stop worrying.

1130
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,913
You know where I found them?

1131
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,190
They were in a shoe box!

1132
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,508
How about a bonus?

1133
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,148
I kept a few.

1134
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,275
Who was it?

1135
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,869
Tell me his name.
It was a man?

1136
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,196
Warn Paula...

1137
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,349
Hurry!

1138
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,632
I must see Mr. Clement.

1139
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,991
He's usually here at this time,
but today he's out.

1140
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,192
It's strange, he didn't call.
You can wait here.

1141
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,396
BEAUTY SALON TO RENT

1142
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,397
I'll wait in his office.

1143
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,479
Is the boss back?

1144
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,956
It's the dame from
the Vercel agency. She's nervy!

1145
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,639
She crashed his office.

1146
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,515
- You let her?
- She just bolted past me!

1147
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,629
Hello?

1148
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,553
What happened?

1149
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,719
One: Massoulier.
Two: Vercel's wife.

1150
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,356
Three: The Eden cashier.
Bodies right and left.

1151
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,152
Make up your mind.

1152
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,396
Are you with us or against us?

1153
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,748
And now, a third murder.

1154
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,316
Following the shooting
of Jacques Massoulier...

1155
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,796
and the killing
of Marie-Christine Vercel...

1156
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:23,988
the latest victim is
the cashier of the Eden...

1157
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,159
stabbed to death an hour ago
in the darkened cinema.

1158
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,391
The circumstantial evidence
points to Julien Vercel...

1159
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,431
who disappeared 3 days ago.

1160
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,950
A city-wide search
is under way for Vercel.

1161
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,832
The police blocked
all the city exists.

1162
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,589
The killer's arrest is imminent.

1163
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,353
- Mr. Clement, please.
- Hold on.

1164
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,949
I've got to see you right away.

1165
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,837
Did you hear the radio?

1166
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,073
This is goodbye.
Thanks for everything.

1167
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,829
You did your best.
You meant well.

1168
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,238
I've got to go now.

1169
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,555
To the police?

1170
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,796
No, I'm going to see my lawyer.

1171
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,549
You're made!
There are roadblocks all over.

1172
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,877
I'll go by the sea.
My lawyer set it up.

1173
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,593
Please,

1174
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,350
listen to me...

1175
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,908
don't leave.

1176
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,633
I know what I'm doing.

1177
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,193
or take me with you.

1178
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,753
Impossible.

1179
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,430
Because you despise me?

1180
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,312
I don't despise you.

1181
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,431
Well, I despise you...

1182
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,273
and moreover...

1183
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,153
I love you.

1184
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,836
A blind man could see that!

1185
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,156
You've never looked
at me as a woman.

1186
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:15,636
Since I'm not a platinum blonde
with fake eye lashes,

1187
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,637
I haven't got a chance!

1188
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,273
Ask me the question
you asked before.

1189
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,589
I'm asking you.

1190
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,279
The answer is yes.

1191
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,435
You're taking me?

1192
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:20,313
No, I need 24 hours.
I'll call you tomorrow...

1193
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,998
and you'll join me.

1194
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:28,318
I feel like a complete idiot.
Does it mean I'm in love?

1195
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,875
I've felt that way
for the past 6 months.

1196
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,793
I can't wait.

1197
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,639
Wait for what?

1198
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:43,630
Wait for next Sunday.

1199
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,555
Hear that?

1200
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,751
I hear nothing.

1201
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,873
It's not normal.
We always hear street noises.

1202
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,554
Take a look.

1203
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,269
It's quiet.

1204
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,359
Everything's alright.

1205
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,149
It's been two minutes
since I kissed you.

1206
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,836
I know who the killer is.

1207
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,797
Good work!

1208
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,679
You've been despicable
all along!

1209
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:03,875
I didn't kill Massoulier,
I didn't kill my wife...

1210
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:07,197
I didn't kill the Eden cashier.

1211
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,391
Is that your story?

1212
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,718
We could write
a book about your wife.

1213
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:17,710
Did you know she married you
under a false name?

1214
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,354
You're real funny.

1215
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,994
It's no laughing matter.

1216
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,872
Your marriage isn't valid...

1217
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,629
because under her real name
of Josiane Kerbel...

1218
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,389
was married
to a Belgian horse trainer.

1219
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,917
He went to jail for doping a horse.

1220
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,714
He always claimed she did it.

1221
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,389
Meanwhile, she was living it up.

1222
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,309
An ex-lover was blackmailing her,
so she drove to France.

1223
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,513
She got drunk
and ran over a soldier.

1224
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,109
She drove off
leaving him to die on the road.

1225
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,878
So aside from Interpol,

1226
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:57,232
insurance companies
were on her trail. Here you are!

1227
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,871
We've got your client...

1228
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,117
and all your legal
wiles won't get him out.

1229
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,710
Let me go on
with the report on his wife.

1230
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,831
It's very interesting.

1231
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,713
We'll skip the rubber checks.

1232
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,152
She lands in Nice
and opens a beauty salon.

1233
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,670
When you married her,
she heaved a sigh of relief:

1234
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,919
She needed to lie low at that time.
How's that?

1235
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,599
It's still funny.

1236
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,677
Yes, she needed time...

1237
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,553
but with Massoulier around,
it wasn't easy.

1238
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,070
I never speak ill of the dead...

1239
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:39,114
but if it wasn't for Massoulier,
all this mess...

1240
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:45,112
Little boys play with toy railroads,

1241
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,278
stations, houses, cars, garages.

1242
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,439
Later on, they find out they can't
all belong to one man.

1243
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,518
They learn to share,
to go into partnership.

1244
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,150
Massoulier had remained
a little boy:

1245
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,316
He wanted the beauty salon,

1246
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,399
the cinema, the cabaret,
the brothels, he wanted them all!

1247
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,878
Damn it! I remind you that 3 persons
were killed after Massoulier.

1248
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,471
So there's another little boy
in this town who refused to grow up!

1249
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,468
I must see Mr. Santelli!

1250
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,996
Excuse me for interrupting...

1251
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,316
but I've got some information.

1252
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,396
Busybody!

1253
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,953
Let her talk.

1254
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,391
All leads are useful at that point.

1255
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:37,791
A detective agency
in Nice was hired

1256
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,798
to investigate on
Marie-Christine's past.

1257
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,595
It was a phone request
by an unknown client.

1258
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,597
Yes, it's in the file.

1259
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,951
Well, I decided to call
the Nice agency...

1260
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,230
and I learned that the client...

1261
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,632
sent them a picture
of Marie-Christine

1262
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,319
in a typed envelope.

1263
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:58,999
Do you have the envelope?

1264
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,760
If I get it,
can you identify it?

1265
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,838
In 3 days, I can trace
any typewriter owner.

1266
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,917
Wait...

1267
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,513
The detective has just left home.

1268
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,995
By now,
he should be in the office

1269
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,236
searching for the envelope.

1270
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:17,273
As soon as he does,
he'll call us here.

1271
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:20,478
I gave him your phone number.

1272
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:25,478
Thank you for your cooperation.

1273
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,272
You may go now.

1274
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,875
May I read
my client's statement?

1275
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,508
Certainly.

1276
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,676
It's short and sweet:

1277
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:47,033
"I didn't kill Massoulier,
nor my wife.

1278
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:50,789
"I didn't kill Louison,
or the Eden cashier. "

1279
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,037
It's not much help.

1280
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,519
Santelli speaking.

1281
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,873
I don't know. I'm busy.

1282
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,433
I'm tied up here

1283
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,079
for at least an hour.

1284
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,838
It's very simple, honey.

1285
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,311
Use the potatoes while they're hot.

1286
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,353
You may burn your fingers,
but never mind.

1287
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,754
I get it, darling.

1288
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,518
Then, you pour the white wine

1289
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,869
on the potatoes,

1290
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,877
but slice them thin. Got it?

1291
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:29,868
Yes, but hurry because
the kids have to go to school.

1292
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,991
The table's set and we're waiting.

1293
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,110
Cut it out...

1294
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,833
I need the line

1295
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,792
for an important call.
Bye, darling.

1296
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,951
It was my old lady.

1297
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,835
What are you doing?

1298
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,636
Your conversation made me hungry.

1299
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,276
I'll just hop out for a sandwich.

1300
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,559
They can send someone for it.

1301
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,429
I prefer to take a walk.

1302
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,709
Come with me.

1303
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,396
- Don't lose him.
- OK.

1304
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,430
Is Lablache still on the line?

1305
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:17,356
He's on hold.

1306
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:22,676
It looks as if my lawyer will be
needing a good lawyer.

1307
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,633
Hold on, Mr. Lablache,
Mr. Santelli wants to talk to you.

1308
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,716
Lablache? Santelli speaking.

1309
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,399
I'm still here.

1310
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,355
It's working as planned.
He just left. He's about to call you.

1311
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,029
Tell me what I should say.

1312
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,550
Just keep him talking
till he hangs himself.

1313
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:42,790
I'll hang up.

1314
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,991
Fine. We'll both hang up!

1315
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,035
Come down, Miss-know-it-all!

1316
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,159
She did well in the role of my wife.

1317
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,510
We had to needle the lawyer.

1318
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:57,393
Did you see him
with those cigarettes?

1319
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,239
I planned to nail him...

1320
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:02,590
while he was helping me run away.

1321
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,394
- He could've killed you.
- It's true.

1322
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,831
When did you suspect him?

1323
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,555
I never trusted him
since he handled my divorce.

1324
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,352
I had to slap him down.

1325
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,152
What for?

1326
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,511
To make him
remove his hand from my bra.

1327
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,632
A groping hand doesn't
always mean a killer...

1328
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,879
Or else,
Jambrau'd be in jail for life.

1329
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,669
OK,

1330
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,557
but while I was waiting
in his office...

1331
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,870
I noticed something suspicious.

1332
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,076
I leaned against the wall.

1333
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:14,233
It led to Marie-Christine's
former beauty salon.

1334
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:18,592
A fantastic gimmick
to have a secret affair

1335
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,119
in a small town.

1336
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,154
I also noticed a card
from the Lablache agency

1337
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,430
and a picture of Marie-Christine
in Clement's arms.

1338
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,791
It all added up.

1339
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:38,036
He's just gone
into to phone booth!

1340
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,592
Lablache speaking.

1341
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,598
Last week,
I requested a little inquest.

1342
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,830
I mailed you a picture
in an envelope.

1343
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,349
I see.
I just got to the office.

1344
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,471
I don't know if it's still here.

1345
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,831
I'm pretty sure
it's been destroyed.

1346
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,510
Mr. Lablache,
are you a gambler?

1347
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,278
When the odds are good.

1348
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,268
I'll bet a handsome amount
you won't find that envelope.

1349
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,948
What do you mean
by handsome amount?

1350
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,076
15,000 Frs.

1351
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,510
But destroying evidence...

1352
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,755
Who says it's evidence?

1353
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,712
You simply won't find...

1354
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,673
an envelope that was discarded

1355
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,916
in a wastebasket 3 days ago.

1356
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,037
I'm willing to bet 30,000 Frs.

1357
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,913
It's my final price.

1358
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,519
Forget all I said.

1359
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,471
You were putting me on.

1360
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:42,035
The die is cast!

1361
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,719
Give the envelope to the cops...

1362
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,798
but keep Marie-Christine's picture.

1363
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,436
I killed her
because she no longer loved me,

1364
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,358
Massoulier
because she asked me to.

1365
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:53,596
I killed Paula
because she guessed the truth

1366
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,189
and Louison
because he was blackmailing me.

1367
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,432
I was about to kill Vercel.

1368
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,870
I don't belong
to the brotherhood of men.

1369
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:05,230
Everything
I've done was for women.

1370
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,796
I like to look at them
and to touch them.

1371
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,470
I enjoy giving them pleasure.

1372
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:17,598
Women are magic,
so I became a magician.

1373
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,076
In one minute,
there'll be another corpse here.

1374
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,517
I see them approaching.

1375
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,798
Sorry to let you down,

1376
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,752
you've just lost 30,000 Frs.


1
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:23,997
DAY FOR NIGHT

2
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:26,397
Let's all be qulet and play well.

3
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:37,359
Slowly and relaxed, In my tempo...

4
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:42,757
From the beglnnlng...

5
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:47,044
Strlke up together...

6
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:53,286
Here you can speed up...

7
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:01,396
Don't leave any gaps...

8
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,003
There, now all together...

9
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,442
Hold that last chord...

10
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,197
No sentlmentallty.

11
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,959
Just play the notes.

12
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:54,445
Thls fllm Is dedlcated
to Dorothy and Lillian Gish

13
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:58,324
Cut!

14
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,678
Everyone over here, please!

15
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:06,957
We'll do it again, right away!

16
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:13,205
What happened
coming out of the subway?

17
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,881
Last time it was better.

18
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,805
The bus was 2 seconds late.

19
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,680
The background activity
was late, too.

20
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,281
By the beauty parlor,

21
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:26,564
a lady was supposed to come out.

22
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,560
I never saw the cyclist go by,
either.

23
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,805
We'll do it again.

24
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:35,359
What went wrong was the beginning,

25
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,120
coming out of the subway.

26
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,684
Everyone came out together,
then there was no one.

27
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:45,038
Note start and end footages,
circle the good takes...

28
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,323
- Who do you give it to?
- Yourself!

29
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,159
You mean, I keep it?

30
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,205
Kill that arc!

31
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,677
Ladies and gentlemen,

32
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:59,203
here we are
at the Victorine Studios, in Nice,

33
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,399
where shooting starts today
on "Meet Pamela".

34
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:06,276
But today you won't meet Pamela!

35
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:10,480
The Hollywood star, Julie Baker
who plays Pamela

36
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:13,320
is eXpected soon,
but hasn't arrived yet.

37
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,399
But the other stars are here,

38
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,161
and I hope
to interview them shortly.

39
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,280
The slap may make it swell.
I don't mind!

40
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,602
Meet our male lead.

41
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:27,876
Mr. Bertrand!

42
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,727
You're the producer,
come and talk to us!

43
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,082
A producer should stay out of sight.

44
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,561
It's the story

45
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,122
of an older man

46
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:41,075
whose son brings home
an English bride.

47
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:44,957
It's the story of a young man
who marries an English girl.

48
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:49,484
3 months later he brings her
to his parents' Riviera home.

49
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:52,281
My character falls in love

50
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,358
with his daughter-in-law,
and she with him.

51
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,762
She falls in love
with her father-in-law.

52
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:00,801
The movie tells the story
of their illicit love affair.

53
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,076
What happens?

54
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:05,205
As in any tragedy, each character

55
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,959
must fulfill his destiny.

56
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,960
EXcuse me,
they need me on the set.

57
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,361
Pamela 1, take 4!

58
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:18,319
The bus!

59
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,118
Newsvendor, be livelier!

60
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:33,764
The lady with the dog, faster!

61
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:36,487
More activity around the subway!

62
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,559
Now the white car!

63
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:42,557
Alphonse, get ready!

64
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,524
Come out of the subway!

65
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:49,960
Faster!

66
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,001
Cafe terrace, more activity!

67
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,602
Lady with the dog, keep going!

68
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,479
Red car!

69
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,123
Faster, red car!

70
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,364
Red car, drive off!

71
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:10,758
Ready, Walter?
Move in on AleXander.

72
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,803
Move in closer!

73
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,363
Cut!

74
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,245
We'll do it from another angle.

75
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,157
Roll it!

76
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,516
Take 2.

77
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:25,804
Cut!

78
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,925
The last one was good.

79
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,720
Places, everyone! Once more!

80
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,886
Let's go!

81
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:08,919
This is the Atlantic Hotel.

82
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,846
In Nice.
Hold on, please.

83
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,077
I have a bathroom,
I wanted a shower.

84
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,442
Can I change rooms?

85
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:19,361
- Mine's a shower, I want a tub!
- We can trade!

86
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,518
Come on, let's go up! Great!

87
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:35,922
Julie's pictures!

88
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,846
OK, Joelle.

89
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,479
Julie's pictures...
Thanks, Odile.

90
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,366
Walter, have a look.
The pictures of Julie.

91
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:52,076
I remember her in that movie
with the car-chase.

92
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,198
Didn't she freak out once?

93
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,564
A minor depression. Over a year ago!

94
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,683
She walked out of a production!

95
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,725
Yes, but now she's married
to her doctor.

96
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,276
She must be fine now.

97
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,721
Is Bertrand worried?

98
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,366
I don't think so.

99
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,483
That's a good likeness.
She's lovely.

100
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,126
Any with her hair short?

101
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,766
Here's the wig.

102
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,441
- It's too dark.
- Could be lighter...

103
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,361
She'll wear a wig in "Pamela".

104
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,165
She has lovely eyes.

105
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:25,160
Yes, they're light green.

106
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,085
Looks just like her mother!

107
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:29,715
Good face, nice shape to it.

108
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,083
So pleasant...

109
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:34,045
Here's a good one!
She looks sad, but seXy.

110
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,921
EXcuse me, sir.
I'd like to show you the...

111
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:40,043
Sure, Bernard, show it to us.

112
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,836
The trick candle
for the costume party.

113
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,680
Plugging it in, turns it on.
Got a light?

114
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:49,362
If the actress keeps
it toward her face,

115
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,882
the light seems
to come from the candle!

116
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,277
She mustn't turn the candle

117
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,438
toward the camera,

118
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,916
or it'll give away the trick.

119
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:00,995
OK?

120
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,200
OK, Bernard. Sold.

121
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:05,641
And the wire goes?

122
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:08,685
In the sleeve and down the dress.

123
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,724
Look at this vase!

124
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,843
Not bad for a hotel vase.

125
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,358
I'd like to see it

126
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,882
in Severine's dining room
in the movie!

127
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,515
- It's cracked!
- Just swipe it!

128
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,365
Hi, Liliane. Hi, Alphonse.

129
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,880
These are for you!

130
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,719
Thanks for the trainee job.

131
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:35,720
Think you'll like
being a script-girl?

132
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:39,038
It's hard to say,
after one day!

133
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:41,767
It's a terrific job, you'll see.

134
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:43,326
I'll let you know in 2 months.

135
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,364
Right... So long, kids.

136
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,121
You didn't tell me!

137
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:49,442
He's stone deaf!

138
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:53,566
So what? Happened in the army.
Artillery fire!

139
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,366
Do me a favor.

140
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,995
Walk ahead,
so I can watch your ass.

141
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:01,646
Like this?

142
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:04,045
Yes, like that!

143
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,078
- I saw you!
- Saw me what?

144
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:27,522
- You're hot for the maid.
- I am?

145
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:28,836
Bastard!

146
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:32,397
She's your type.
A bouncy little duckling.

147
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,717
Don't tell me you're jealous!

148
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:38,277
Absolutely not!
Jealousy is dumb.

149
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:40,682
Or you have go all the way...

150
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,200
and commit murder!

151
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,119
You're the jealous type.

152
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:47,355
I can tell: your eyebrows meet.

153
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,641
My eyebrows meet?

154
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,919
No, they don't!

155
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,524
Those 2 beds look Ionely,
maybe they should meet.

156
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,163
We have to move the table.

157
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:02,480
You could've asked for a double bed!

158
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,477
It meant asking Lajoie,
the new production manager.

159
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,965
It's heavy!

160
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,237
There.

161
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:18,639
Now the second!

162
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,402
It's tougher than moving audiences!

163
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,885
What'll we do tonight?

164
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:33,244
Pierrot, the stills man,
gave me a list

165
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,559
of great little restaurants
up in the hills.

166
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,281
"Great little restaurants"!

167
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,683
We have to eat, don't we?

168
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,759
You must be kidding!

169
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,725
This town has 37 movie theaters!

170
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:49,117
We look in the papers, pick a movie,

171
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:52,643
go there and make sure
when it starts.

172
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:56,516
And if there's time,
we grab a sandwich.

173
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:03,002
Your stills man can take his list

174
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,522
of cute little "bistros"

175
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,325
and shove it!

176
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,000
You're impossible!

177
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,279
Listen, tonight,

178
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,718
I'm not going to a movie
or eating in this hotel

179
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,366
You decide.

180
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,518
OK, we'll do what you want...

181
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,240
But on one condition!

182
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,886
Which is?

183
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,764
That you marry me.

184
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,924
Odile, try this on.
It's for your scene.

185
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,839
Hold that. Not bad, huh?

186
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,077
Let's see the apron.

187
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,803
- Sold?
- I buy it.

188
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,597
Shootlng a movle Is llke
a stagecoach ride in the Old West.

189
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,644
At flrst you hope for a nlce trlp.

190
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,480
Soon you just hope
to reach your destination!

191
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,797
EXcuse me for bothering you, sir.

192
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,720
I'm the new production manager,
Lajoie.

193
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:14,479
About the car for Pamela's accident.

194
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,359
You have to choose one.

195
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,006
One of those two?

196
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,920
Can the white one be painted blue?

197
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,563
Sure for Fr650!

198
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,924
Just to paint it blue?
We'll use it as it is!

199
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,317
But it is very white...

200
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,998
What about that blue one?

201
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:36,204
It belongs to your assistant,
Jean-FranÁois!

202
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,881
Maybe he won't mind.

203
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,157
- I'll ask him.
- Yes, do that.

204
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,758
What Is a fllm-dlrector?

205
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:47,317
Someone who's asked questlons
about everything.

206
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,922
Sometlmes he knows the answers.

207
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:54,563
- You liked this location?
- It was fine. You were right

208
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:56,877
We were lucky, too. Great weather!

209
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,720
- Want to see the bungalow?
- Sure, let's go!

210
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,481
It's not built yet.
Just the sketches.

211
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,122
The interior will be furnished.

212
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:09,199
Bed, night tables,
chairs, table with...

213
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,804
Hold on!
The camera will never go inside.

214
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,726
We'll only shoot
through the window.

215
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,560
So all we'll ever see is the bed.

216
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,643
Sorry to bother you, but...

217
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,919
The Americans insist
on the original schedule.

218
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,805
You only have 7 weeks.

219
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:37,556
- Think you can do it?
- It won't be easy.

220
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:41,119
If you need 3 or 4 days
for pick-up shots,

221
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,642
we'll use a skeleton crew.

222
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,685
But the actors
must be released by Oct. 31st.

223
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:50,678
I'll go over the schedule
with Jean-FranÁois.

224
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:56,082
7 weeks.
Five days a week. 35 days!

225
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:58,522
I can't shoot thls scrlpt
in 35 days.

226
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,883
Can you look at this?

227
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,003
It's Severine's wig...

228
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,318
Isn't it a little too light?

229
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:10,002
Too light? I really don't know.

230
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,920
Tell Joelle to see Walter about it.

231
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,555
He's the cameraman, they can decide.

232
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,323
Props wants to see you.

233
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,205
Which gun do you like
for the final scene?

234
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,877
Alphonse has small hands.

235
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:34,357
But we won't take the smallest...
This one!

236
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:39,079
"Pamela" crew
report to screening room.

237
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,560
Here they are!

238
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:46,164
Rank and file all present
and accounted for? Good!

239
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:49,205
You'd be lost without
the rank and file!

240
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,643
What rushes are we seeing?

241
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,605
Severine and Alphonse...

242
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,884
- And the crowd scene?
- It didn't come in.

243
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,397
That's strange.
The crowd scene's missing.

244
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:04,279
Call and ask the lab in Paris.

245
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,402
It's Scene 1.

246
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,041
Go ahead...
Wait! Where's Severine?

247
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,685
She never comes to rushes.

248
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:18,245
- Where's AleXander?
- At the airport, as usual.

249
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:19,681
He goes every day!

250
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:22,315
He must be eXpecting someone.

251
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,443
I bet he has personal problems.

252
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:31,080
Mother, I have to talk to you.

253
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,438
It's about them, do you mlnd?

254
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:35,325
- Yesl
- I have to!

255
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:38,440
I've found out they're In Parls.

256
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:40,878
They're not even hldlng.

257
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,517
Why torture yourself?

258
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:48,636
Be llke me. Don't thlnk about them.

259
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,445
That's all I thlnk about.

260
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:54,882
Let's go away.
Just the two of us, far away.

261
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,356
We'll do whatever you want.

262
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:05,365
I've made up my mlnd
to go to Paris.

263
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,126
to klll them bothl

264
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,842
Use the "Not even hiding"
from Take 3.

265
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:01,238
We've got a big problem.

266
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,238
A power failure at the lab.

267
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:07,116
It ruined the crowd scene,
it has to be re-shot.

268
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,640
- When can you do it?
- Day after tomorrow...

269
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:14,482
Not before Monday!
We have to round up 150 eXtras!

270
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,844
- The insurance?
- I presume we're covered.

271
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,636
The way to make money today
is in real estate, not movies!

272
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:24,321
I stay in it, because I love it...

273
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,799
If we have to re-shoot the scene,
we will.

274
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,964
How are you, AleXander?

275
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,641
- That's nice. Is it for me?
- No, it's not.

276
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,967
Lajoie, our production manager.

277
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,960
- What's that?
- A bouquet for Madame Severine.

278
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,039
Wrapped in newspaper?
Go wrap it properly!

279
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,485
Tell me...

280
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,001
Does Severine know
I play her husband?

281
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,998
Of course. She was delighted.

282
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:01,756
That's good.

283
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,201
Go say hello to her.

284
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,119
Where's her dressing-room?

285
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,277
I'm so happy to see you!

286
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,005
Gorgeous as ever!

287
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:33,843
What about you?
How do you keep so young?

288
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:40,118
- I'm delighted to work with you.
- So am I!

289
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:44,003
Remember when we first met
in Hollywood?

290
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,999
No dates! Never mention numbers!

291
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,727
Or I'll tell everyone
you had a facelift!

292
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,002
Not yet. It's coming!

293
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,205
You know what? For you...

294
00:19:56,447 --> 00:20:00,122
I might take up cooking again!

295
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:03,723
Remember how you loved
my risotto Milanese?

296
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:05,525
Well, I don't any more!

297
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:10,885
Just kidding!
I'll eat your risotto any time!

298
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,523
- Are we working together today?
- No, it's you and Alphonse.

299
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:16,917
I'm going to the airport.
See you.

300
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,363
Isn't he adorable?

301
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,676
When did I work with him... ?

302
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:30,683
20 years ago, in Hollywood!

303
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,476
We were there at the same time.

304
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,600
You know, he was a real ladies man.

305
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,883
In Hollywood, they called him...

306
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,923
- I loved him, too.
- Is he married?

307
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:45,879
I don't know if he is now.

308
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,637
He was married and divorced twice.

309
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,445
Maybe he lives with someone.

310
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:54,201
No one knows. He's very secretive.

311
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:57,525
He has a moustache in the movie.
I like it.

312
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:01,762
Moustache or not,
he's still playing lovers!

313
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,478
And look at me...
I'm only cast as the neglected wife!

314
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:10,037
Desperate... tragic... a real pain...

315
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,283
- You're lovely!
- No way...

316
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:15,440
Cue me for my scene today.

317
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,438
I can't remember a line!

318
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:22,757
For some reason, lately...

319
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,680
my memory has gone to hell.

320
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:38,963
EXcellent dressing-room.

321
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:42,961
Nice and spacious.
Only the flowers are missing.

322
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:44,685
They've been ordered.

323
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:48,239
You know,
I admire Julie Baker as much as you.

324
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,005
You wanted her, we got her!

325
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,920
But if she has a breakdown,
we've had it!

326
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:53,997
What do you mean?

327
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:58,365
After the medical eXam,
the doctor refused to insure her.

328
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:02,043
Said she's still too nervous,
and we should postpone

329
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:03,481
the shoot for a month!

330
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:05,763
What did the Americans say?

331
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,997
They're more fleXible
than the French.

332
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,283
They're gambling with us.

333
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:14,519
But if we lose,
no one'll take the blame.

334
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,484
We'll all be in hot water!

335
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:19,805
You have to trust
your luck sometimes...

336
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,639
You're right.

337
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:24,199
Still, it's a gamble!

338
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:28,676
- Seen Severine since the rushes?
- I went to say hello.

339
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,839
You know she had
an affair with AleXander?

340
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,680
- I heard...
- Very stormy.

341
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,724
Lots of publicity!

342
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,525
It ended badly.

343
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:43,397
For 4 years, no producer
could get them to work together.

344
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:45,479
They hated each other!

345
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,445
But time heals all wounds.

346
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:52,277
- Hello, Alphonse!
- Got a minute?

347
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,001
- Remember my check!
- It's all I think of.

348
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,441
Me, too!

349
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:58,320
This'll only take a minute.

350
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,880
Great dressing-room!
Nicer than mine!

351
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,526
It's Julie's...

352
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,757
I'm getting married to Liliane.

353
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,679
Fine. I'm glad to hear it.

354
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:10,998
Here in Nice.
Before we finish shooting.

355
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:14,637
I wondered...
Would you mind being my best man?

356
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,719
Not at all! I'd be delighted.

357
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,162
You think this looks all right?

358
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:22,887
- It's not bad...
- Nice blue.

359
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:29,283
Hit the fireplace
with a Senior spot!

360
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,325
A little more.

361
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,160
That's good, hold it!

362
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:38,076
Now a barndoor on the fire,
or we won't see it.

363
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:44,198
I can't take my eyes off the fire.

364
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:48,118
People used to stare at fires,

365
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,555
now they watch TV.

366
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,041
We need to see

367
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:54,000
moving images,
especially after dinner.

368
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,441
I never thought of that.

369
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,284
Alphonse told me.
I'm very happy for you.

370
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:01,597
Congratulations.

371
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,246
Congratulations?

372
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,000
Gilbert, light the 103.

373
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,242
Put out the fire!

374
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,278
It's smoking up the set.

375
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,484
I'd like you to meet
two German girls.

376
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:21,882
They're sisters: Greta and Diana.

377
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:24,363
She was in a big
German political film.

378
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:25,795
Do you do any?

379
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:29,797
She was in an erotic film.
Why don't you do one?

380
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,520
I have a good script

381
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,319
about pollution.

382
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:36,001
EXcuse me. We've got problem.

383
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,476
- What problem?
- I'm rescuing you!

384
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,357
Meet Mr. Giacometti.

385
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,396
Got a minute?

386
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,920
After this shot.

387
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:49,517
- Who's that guy?
- The cop who OK'd us to shoot

388
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:52,878
in the streets. So Bertrand
invited him to watch us work.

389
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:56,041
That's nice! Do I watch him work?

390
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:58,084
When he interrogates people?

391
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,202
Severine, we're ready.

392
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:11,040
You start here.

393
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,319
Quiet! A full rehearsal.

394
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,043
Let's go Severine.

395
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:21,282
"I don't understand you, AleXander!

396
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,320
"You're..."

397
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:24,960
"Peculiar."

398
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:28,717
It's all right!
Take it from the top, right away.

399
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,362
"I don't understand you, AleXander.

400
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,962
"You've been peculiar, lately.

401
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:39,357
"Walking out on dinner last night!

402
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:41,518
"That was an insult to Julie."

403
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,359
Damn! I said Julie for Pamela!

404
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:44,956
Not to worry.

405
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,446
That's bad...

406
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:48,764
Don't worry... Once more.

407
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,042
I've got an idea!

408
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:54,036
I'll use numbers,
the way I do with Fellini!

409
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:58,196
Instead of: "I don't
understand you, AleXander..."

410
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:01,757
I'll say: 22, 83, 16, 72...

411
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,199
5, 3, 18, 9, 14, 7, 9...

412
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:07,844
17, 10, 10, 4,

413
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,804
18, 69...

414
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,277
Impossible, Severine!

415
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,917
In France,
we have to say the lines.

416
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,396
See? We're recording direct sound.

417
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,717
We'll find another solution.

418
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:24,597
You always give me the scene
at the last minute!

419
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,156
Then we'll use prompt-cards.

420
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,443
Joelle, come here, darling.

421
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,366
It's all your fault.

422
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:33,596
"I don't understand you...

423
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:37,998
"You've been peculiar lately."

424
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:42,004
- Cut lots, we'll need them!
- Who asked you?

425
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,557
Are they placed right?

426
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,277
The last one's back there.

427
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:52,646
- Shooting now!
- Wait! Sound's reloading.

428
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:54,559
Sound's ready!

429
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,445
Hurry, Bernard!

430
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:06,682
"I don't understand you, AleXander.

431
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,961
"You've been peculiar

432
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:12,000
"lately.

433
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:15,440
"Walking out on dinner last night!

434
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:18,599
"That was an insult to... Pamela.

435
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,756
"After all, she is Alphonse's wife!

436
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:24,205
"You seem...

437
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:28,155
"to hate her!
You never speak to her.

438
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,883
"What do you want?
We're talking. Go away!

439
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,557
"And I won't tolerate that! "

440
00:27:40,247 --> 00:27:41,441
Cut!

441
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:44,083
I did it!

442
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:45,716
Wasn't it good?

443
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:51,243
- Yes, but that's not the door!
- I thought it was.

444
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:54,444
That's the closet. There's the door.

445
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,404
Let's do it again.

446
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:59,043
We'll do it again.

447
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:02,756
- I thought it was the same door.
- It's all right. Ready!

448
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,997
They do look alike.

449
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:16,283
"I don't understand you, AleXander.

450
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,156
"You've been peculiar lately.

451
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:24,684
"Walking out on dinner last night!
That was an insult to Pamela.

452
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,805
"After all, she is Alphonse's wife!

453
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,159
"You seem to hate her,

454
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:32,238
"you never speak to her!

455
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,159
"What do you want? We're talking!

456
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:38,601
"Go away!

457
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,481
"And I won't tolerate that! "

458
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:48,562
Darling, look...

459
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,038
I know the doors are alike, but...

460
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,638
Not that one. This one!

461
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,236
You're my only friend!

462
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,638
Come to my dressing-room?

463
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:14,121
Come see me. Be nice!

464
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:27,962
"I don't understand you, AleXander.

465
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,803
"You've been peculiar lately.

466
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:36,246
"Walking out on dinner last night!
That was an insult to Pamela.

467
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,523
"After all, she is Alphonse's wife! "

468
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:55,082
She'll never do it.

469
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:56,726
It's not my fault!

470
00:29:56,887 --> 00:29:58,559
Cut! Once more.

471
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:02,964
It's not my fault if I'm confused!

472
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:07,405
I don't know if she's Odile,
actress. Or Odile, make-up girl!

473
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:10,923
In my day, acting was acting...

474
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,079
And make-up was make-up!

475
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,483
No wonder I'm confused!

476
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:24,007
Anyone who has no business
on the set,

477
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,806
please leave now! Thanks.

478
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,596
That doesn't mean you have to go.

479
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:49,196
I wanted to go to the movies,
anyway.

480
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,719
Make-up, give me my mirror.

481
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:56,598
It's her fault, she's been boozing.

482
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,486
Her son's dying of leukemia...
She's afraid:

483
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:01,638
a phone call could come any time.

484
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:04,082
She almost turned down the film.

485
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,516
It'll be all right, Severine.

486
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:38,043
We'll take a little break.

487
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:42,121
I'm sorry. Maybe the wig
is giving me a headache.

488
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:45,879
This has never happened before...

489
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,080
It's the first time...

490
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,078
Don't worry, Severine.

491
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,126
Wrap it up for today!

492
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,402
Get some rest.

493
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:56,116
Where's Odile? Not that Odile!

494
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:58,755
Tell the make-up girl
I want my scarf.

495
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:10,478
Why don't you make
political films?

496
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,881
Why don't you make erotlc fllms?

497
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:18,797
You have to flnlsh shootlng
in 7 weeks.

498
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:40,043
Mlss Severlne
needs Odile in make-up.

499
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,316
Who is that woman I keep seeing?

500
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:47,206
Lajoie's wife.
Follows him everywhere.

501
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,120
Shall I try to get rid of her?

502
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,358
No, I'm getting used to her.

503
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,646
I don't know why Ferrand cast me.

504
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,605
- He can't stand me!
- Who told you that?

505
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:02,884
I know he thinks
I'm a lousy actress.

506
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,800
Just between us, maybe he's right.

507
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,276
No, he didn't cast me!
Was it the producer?

508
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:13,482
Something's peculiar
about this film.

509
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:15,922
He never considered anyone else.

510
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,716
- Really?
- I know it.

511
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,566
You never understand anything
anyway!

512
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:27,515
Well, I don't understand this!
It destroys me!

513
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,799
I'm sorry,
I was hired to play a secretary!

514
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,481
No one mentioned a swimsuit!

515
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:36,480
If they had,
I'd have brought my own!

516
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:41,163
It's not in the script,
but the scene plays better.

517
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:44,922
It's a working vacation.
The secretary is a guest.

518
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:47,282
She's swimming,

519
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:49,358
then he dictates a letter.

520
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,076
Sorry, it's impossible.
I'm not being difficult.

521
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:55,238
I even learned to type!

522
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,197
I wasn't told I had to swim.

523
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,437
I won't go near the water!

524
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:05,642
What can we shoot
until she calms down?

525
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:09,720
Until Julie Baker gets here,
the pool scene is all we have!

526
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:12,321
Go talk to her,
try to convince her.

527
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:16,480
An actress who won't appear
in a bathing suit is ludicrous!

528
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:26,602
"Darling! A telegram!

529
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,325
"The children are coming!

530
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:32,321
"Our son got married
and we haven't met his bride!

531
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,718
"No, wait!
Here, this is for you.

532
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,798
"- They're coming?
- Day after tomorrow.

533
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,605
"It's about time!

534
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,001
"I'm delighted.

535
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:43,921
"I'll write Stanley at once.

536
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:49,203
"I have to dictate a letter.
It must go out today.

537
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:50,846
"Coming, sir.

538
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:53,840
"Don't worry,
Stanley will solve it.

539
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:57,966
"If we could just rent
the house across the way!

540
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,886
"Marvelous!
Then they'd be close to us.

541
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:02,275
"Sorry to bother you now.

542
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:04,915
"The letter's to Stanley.

543
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,725
"Dear Stanley...

544
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:10,323
"I'm pleased to announce
the arrival of Alphonse.

545
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:13,365
"and his young bride..."

546
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,761
Now I see why she wouldn't
wear a swimsuit.

547
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:18,246
Why? She's lovely!

548
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,318
Take another look...

549
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:21,916
Good God!

550
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,836
Stacey tricked us!
She's 3 months pregnant!

551
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:30,000
She kept it secret,
so let's tear up her contract.

552
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:34,319
I don't agree.
Frankly, I don't think it shows.

553
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,125
Come over here.

554
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:40,202
Look at our schedule.

555
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,518
She shoots one more day now,

556
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:45,247
and comes back in 6 weeks.

557
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:47,762
By then, it'll show!

558
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,963
We have to replace her.

559
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:53,479
It's not a problem!
We'll pick someone now...

560
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:55,285
and call her agent.

561
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,438
Look, there's lots of girls.

562
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:01,843
Stacey has an iron-clad contract.
Her agent knows it.

563
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,283
I'll lose!

564
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:08,600
You know why?
Because in life, might makes right!

565
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:12,603
Mr Ferrand, a package for you.

566
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,439
The books I ordered.

567
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:21,442
- Delerue, the composer.
- I'll take it.

568
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:26,922
Here's the playback
for the costume party scene.

569
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:53,796
That's lovely, Georges,
thank you!

570
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:00,843
Airport...
Julie's plane... press conference!

571
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:02,486
I can't be late.

572
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:05,919
Say! You like to improvise.

573
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:09,996
Why can't the secretary
be pregnant in the film?

574
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,159
Maybe she could...

575
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:15,239
No! They'd suspect AleXander.

576
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,240
It'll confuse the story-line.
We can't do it.

577
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,844
Come to think of it...

578
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,157
Stacey isn't married!

579
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:28,121
I wonder who the father is?

580
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,758
Your questions, gentlemen.

581
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:15,520
Can you tell us
about your new movie?

582
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,241
"Meet Pamela"
is the story of a British girl

583
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:21,797
who falls in love
with her husband's father.

584
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:25,918
I think it's based on a true story.

585
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,722
How does it end?

586
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:31,517
Since it's a tragedy,

587
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,680
it'll end unhappily.

588
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:37,516
But I'd rather not reveal
all the details.

589
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:41,884
Do you think these days
people care if a girl

590
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:44,607
sleeps with her husband's father?

591
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:54,765
When I like a script enough
to do it,

592
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,441
I think audiences will like it, too.

593
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:58,716
You do?

594
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:00,366
Yes, and I hope I'm right.

595
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:04,799
Forgive me for intruding
into your private life,

596
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,925
but American papers reported

597
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:11,324
that after being ill,
you married your doctor.

598
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:15,885
No, I didn't marry my doctor.
I married a man who's a doctor!

599
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,840
Why isn't the lucky man among us?

600
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:22,926
My husband came with me.
In fact he's here,

601
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,680
in this very room.

602
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:26,235
Where is he?

603
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,279
Sorry, he hates publicity.

604
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,085
On that little note of mystery,

605
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:34,762
we'll end this,
and let Miss Baker go to her hotel.

606
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,836
Let the reporters leave first.

607
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:53,125
This is my husband, Dr Nelson.

608
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,718
Could you move back, please?

609
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,963
You're in the shot, there.

610
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,399
Thank you very much.

611
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:08,765
She's always around!

612
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,797
- She's Lajoie's wife...
- She thinks she's a crew member?

613
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:17,563
No, she thinks women are after him!
She makes his life hell.

614
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:19,445
He's too weak to dump her.

615
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:22,679
We call them
"The Sorrow and the Pity"!

616
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,283
Lajoie, we're ready to shoot.

617
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:28,801
What's going on there?

618
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,645
I don't like that at all!

619
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:33,838
You have "le trac"?

620
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,606
What does that mean?

621
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:41,640
Liliane! Slate this one, please!

622
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:43,804
Our stills man's very busy!

623
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,277
Roll it!

624
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:53,999
The car!

625
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:14,083
"Hello, children!

626
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:15,926
"My parents...

627
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,598
"Meet Pamela! "

628
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:21,003
Pan over to the stairs!

629
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:24,001
"I know you'll be happy here.

630
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:26,675
"Too bad our house isn't larger.

631
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:29,998
"From the balcony
you can see the sea! "

632
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,486
"She's charming..."

633
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:34,444
"Do you like it? "

634
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:39,322
"My son never tells me anything!

635
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,921
"I don't even know how you met."

636
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:46,158
"I was on vacation in Yorkshire
with my 2 cousins,

637
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:47,965
"Dorothy and Elizabeth.

638
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:50,118
"He had a date with Dorothy.

639
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:53,563
"She got chicken-poX,
so I went on the date.

640
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:56,717
"I don't know Dorothy,

641
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,560
"but I'm glad
you didn't get chicken-poX! "

642
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,206
"Who got chicken-poX? "

643
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:02,357
"Guess! "

644
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:04,082
Cut!

645
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:05,636
How was it?

646
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:07,763
Not bad,
but we'll try something else.

647
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,165
We're doing it again?

648
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,840
Was I late?

649
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,963
We'll try it differently.

650
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,887
- Take a break, Severine.
- Odile!

651
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:26,962
I wanted you with me,
so I got you the job!

652
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:29,916
I wanted us to be together.

653
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:33,523
But learning to be a script-girl
is a waste of time.

654
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:35,484
I want to learn film-editing.

655
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,796
Film-editing?

656
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:40,562
You just had to say the word!
I'd have arranged it!

657
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:45,324
You're here to take stills, right?

658
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:54,280
Odile!
Get that bottle out of my sight!

659
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:57,805
How's your mother?

660
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:00,640
Fine! I told her
we were working together.

661
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:02,445
She sends her love.

662
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:05,804
Marvelous woman!
Everyone in Hollywood loved her.

663
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,164
Too bad she quit when she did.

664
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:10,636
But she's still very busy.

665
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,641
She hated the way we shoot movies,

666
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:15,479
in bits and pieces!

667
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,279
I remember escorting her
to the premiere

668
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:21,722
of her first big Hollywood movie.

669
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:23,320
A fantastic evening!

670
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:25,159
When the film ended

671
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:28,239
she sat there,
then turned to me and said:

672
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,878
"I did all that?
All I remember is the waiting."

673
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:33,002
It's so true!

674
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,802
I'm calm, not yelling.
But I say you're on the make!

675
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:40,164
- That's not true!
- Oh, no? I'm in agony!

676
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:44,366
I'm in agony all the time!
I can't wait to finish a scene,

677
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:47,883
so I can go look for you!
I'm a complete wreck!

678
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:49,919
I can't find Alphonse!

679
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,520
I know where he is.

680
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:59,600
While I'm shooting, I'm in agony!

681
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:03,440
Can I shoot a scene
when I'm like this?

682
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,878
I'm supposed to keep cool!

683
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,441
If I'm no good, you're to blame!

684
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,761
I'm sorry to make you die again.

685
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:26,123
I'm used to it.
In 80 movies, I've died 24 times.

686
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:29,205
Electrocuted twice, hanged twice,

687
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,801
I've been knifed,
committed suicide,

688
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:35,604
died in accidents,
but never a natural death.

689
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:38,679
Anyway,
I don't think death is natural.

690
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:46,245
Julie will be right out,
she's changing.

691
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:48,967
- Did things go well?
- I'm very pleased.

692
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:52,324
I've never used an actress
I hadn't met before.

693
00:44:52,487 --> 00:44:56,116
But Julie's just right,
determined, yet fragile.

694
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:58,198
She's perfect for the role.

695
00:44:58,367 --> 00:44:59,800
It'll go fine.

696
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:41,322
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stacey.

697
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:44,238
It'll take 5 minutes, Bernard.

698
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,722
You won't miss your plane.

699
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,797
Ready with the pool scene?

700
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,525
Good, let's run it.

701
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:05,797
I need you.

702
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:08,197
I have an urgent letter to dlctate.

703
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:09,846
Yes slr. Rlght away.

704
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:17,640
- It doesn't show at all.
- You're sure? Good!

705
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:20,357
- That's lovely.
- If you say so...

706
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:22,001
It's not too... ?

707
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:31,561
- So it's OK?
- You can leave, don't worry.

708
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,842
Have a nice trip.

709
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:40,836
Now run the rest...

710
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:03,482
Know what?

711
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,603
I want to touch you.

712
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:09,325
- What's that set?
- The love-nest.

713
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:13,078
- It's in the script!
- I never read scripts.

714
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,637
It's when AleXander
runs off with Pamela.

715
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:20,678
They stop at a shady motel...

716
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:22,200
Get it?

717
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,996
It's morning,
they want to make love.

718
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,159
She puts the tray outside
to keep the maid out.

719
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:31,885
I'll leave.
You're not in this scene.

720
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:34,838
Don't worry, I'll be around.

721
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,318
Let me ask you...

722
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:39,715
Are women magic?

723
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:42,082
No, they're not.
Neither are men.

724
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:44,636
If a woman says
she's known outstanding men,

725
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:46,843
it means she's slept around...

726
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:53,684
EXcuse me, sir.

727
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,559
I have to take 3 days off.

728
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:04,126
You're leaving the crew?

729
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:05,959
My mother just died.

730
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:09,836
- I see. Was it sudden?
- No, she was in great pain.

731
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:11,884
For her, it was a relief.

732
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:16,086
- I see. Well, go ahead.
- But someone will fill in for me.

733
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:18,363
Sure, I understand.

734
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:22,795
I think we can start now.

735
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:28,324
You're not in the way, doctor.

736
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:31,001
Sit down. This shot should be fun.

737
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:36,166
I came to say goodbye.
My plane leaves in an hour.

738
00:48:36,407 --> 00:48:38,841
If I'm through, I'll drive you.

739
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,678
What are we waiting for now?

740
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:43,803
Bernard, as usual.

741
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm ready!

742
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,881
One cat's milk,
another cat's poison!

743
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:57,162
All right, we can go.

744
00:48:57,327 --> 00:48:59,443
Ready, AleXander? Julie?

745
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:12,803
Not too romantic, the kiss...

746
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:29,637
The cat!

747
00:49:43,407 --> 00:49:47,798
The boom is scaring it!
We'll wild-track the sound.

748
00:49:48,047 --> 00:49:49,685
At the fish market!

749
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,926
Cut! Once more!

750
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,805
Do it this time, or else!

751
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:13,437
I swear,
it hasn't been fed in 3 days!

752
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,400
Throw it in!

753
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,805
We'll shoot the scene

754
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,923
when you find
a cat that can act!

755
00:50:26,127 --> 00:50:28,038
I told you to get 2 cats!

756
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,040
Miss Know-it-all!

757
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,676
But when we're through,

758
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:55,560
I still have
to remove my make-up.

759
00:50:55,727 --> 00:50:58,161
Why did you let me down, puss?

760
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,278
You got me in trouble!

761
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:01,806
Now where's Joelle?

762
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:04,967
I found one!
It's the studio cat.

763
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:07,960
I can tell by looking at it,

764
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:09,799
that it won't perform!

765
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:12,356
Don't fight.
We'll try the studio cat.

766
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:15,806
Places, everybody!

767
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,156
The kiss...

768
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,763
The tray...

769
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:22,676
The door...

770
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:26,957
The cat!

771
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:39,246
Focus!

772
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:58,765
Focus on the cat!

773
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:28,480
EXcuse me...
Can I ask you something?

774
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:32,725
In your opinion, are women magic?

775
00:52:35,327 --> 00:52:36,806
Some are, yes.

776
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,761
Others, no!

777
00:52:55,087 --> 00:52:57,920
Don't worry.
Julie will be fine.

778
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:00,920
Yes, she's very happy on this film.

779
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:02,839
I'm sure she'll come through.

780
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:06,317
- Actors are so vulnerable!
- Of course they are.

781
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,397
Everyone is afraid of being judged.

782
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:11,239
But actors

783
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:14,042
are always being judged.

784
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:16,807
In your work, and in your life!

785
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:20,357
We wonder what people think of us,
if they love us.

786
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:23,478
It must be the same

787
00:53:23,687 --> 00:53:25,245
for all performers.

788
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:29,877
As a child, when Mozart
was asked to play, he'd reply:

789
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:33,363
"Gladly,
but first say you love me."

790
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,082
And in your job,
you're always kissing.

791
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,726
As you say...

792
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:40,958
Yes, we do a lot of kissing.

793
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:45,760
The handshake was invented
to show you're unarmed, friendly.

794
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:48,365
We went one better:

795
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,404
we show our love.

796
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:54,119
"My darling, you're so wonderful..."

797
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:56,959
We need all that!

798
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:39,803
Meet Christian Fersen.
Our director, Mr Ferrand.

799
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,886
Were you waiting outside?
You should've come in.

800
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,366
Do you see what I see?

801
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:50,519
- Are women magic?
- Not women, their legs!

802
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,757
That's why they wear skirts.

803
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,282
Cut the crap! We going to a movie?

804
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:58,521
- When does it start?
- We gotta leave.

805
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:02,521
The kitchen scene must be shot
tomorrow night!

806
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:06,363
The union contract
calls for a 12-hour break.

807
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:09,485
Joelle, we must shoot
the kitchen tomorrow.

808
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:12,438
- Can you work with me tonight?
- OK.

809
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:14,518
So much for the movies!

810
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,045
What's this I hear?

811
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:19,277
Yes,
we do the kitchen scene tomorrow.

812
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:22,917
- Can I have my lines?
- After dinner, tonight.

813
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,079
- That's not much time!
- It's not written yet.

814
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:28,841
Read it once
and put it under your pillow.

815
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:31,760
In the morning,
you'll know it by heart!

816
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:33,525
You're an optimist!

817
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:39,918
Reporters always ask
the same questions.

818
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:42,084
"How does it feel to be famous?

819
00:55:42,247 --> 00:55:45,603
"To be recognized
and asked for autographs? "

820
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:50,682
But no TV program I've seen
ever shows that a working movie-star

821
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:55,438
gets up at 6AM
and gets home at 9PM!

822
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,239
A 15-hour work-day!

823
00:55:58,007 --> 00:55:59,486
Not quite 15 hours.

824
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:03,117
Say 13.
Or 14, if you go to the rushes.

825
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:07,404
Mlss Severlne Isn't In her room.

826
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:15,119
"The Godfather"
is showing all over Nice.

827
00:56:15,287 --> 00:56:17,847
It's wiping out every other movie!

828
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:21,278
Speaking of godfathers,
how about AleXander?

829
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:24,519
He fooled everybody.
We all eXpected a Lolita,

830
00:56:24,687 --> 00:56:27,804
and a handsome Romeo
got off the plane!

831
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:32,438
Maybe he could do
Pamela's car-accident stunt.

832
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:36,486
It's too dangerous!
We need a real stuntman!

833
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,877
Back to the kitchen scene!

834
00:56:39,447 --> 00:56:42,644
That night, AleXander
finds Pamela in the kitchen.

835
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,001
Why the kitchen?

836
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,125
So as not to arouse any suspicions.

837
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:50,161
I'm not happy with my first draft.

838
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:52,881
He: "You know
what's happening to us? "

839
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:55,003
She: "I think I do."
That's bad!

840
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:59,359
Pamela must know,
or her character will seem weak.

841
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:03,440
The scene needs a new idea.
Call your co-writer!

842
00:57:04,207 --> 00:57:07,085
I thought of it. He's in Japan.

843
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,560
He's adapting
Turgenev's "First Love".

844
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,082
Set in modern Japan! Great idea!

845
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:15,920
Better than "Pamela"!
I should've done it!

846
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,317
Want a story-line?

847
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:21,240
How about:
Kissinger's Successful Mission?

848
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,160
Heart Transplant...
Jeweler Knifes Wife.

849
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:26,841
Back to work!
You dictate, I'll type.

850
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:29,436
We promised it to Julie tonight.

851
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:31,723
OK, back to the kitchen...

852
00:57:31,887 --> 00:57:35,038
No more guilt
or sense of shame.

853
00:57:35,207 --> 00:57:39,439
They decide to run away
like thieves in the night.

854
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,246
Pamela could actually say that!

855
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:45,285
We must show
that she's completely lucid.

856
00:57:45,447 --> 00:57:48,598
She loved the son,
now she loves the father.

857
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:52,555
- That must come across.
- Julie eXplained it very well.

858
00:57:52,727 --> 00:57:55,924
Here's her interview,
in the morning paper.

859
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:59,124
"The girl realizes
the boy she married

860
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:02,040
"is only a pale reflection
of his father."

861
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,516
She understood the script! Why?

862
00:58:04,687 --> 00:58:08,475
Because her mother was an actress.
She knows Hollywood,

863
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:12,003
where many kids try to live up
to famous parents.

864
00:58:12,207 --> 00:58:15,040
Fairbanks, Barrymore and others.

865
00:58:15,327 --> 00:58:16,646
AleXander:

866
00:58:17,647 --> 00:58:20,844
"You know what's happening to us? "
Damn, the phone!

867
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:27,597
Mlss Domlnlque Is here,
should she come up?

868
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:31,038
Sorry, I'm working.
I'll call tomorrow.

869
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:32,760
I'll glve her the message.

870
00:58:33,007 --> 00:58:35,965
He's sorry, he has to work tonight.

871
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:38,243
He'll call you tomorrow.

872
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:40,723
- Three guesses?
- Stacked!

873
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:43,082
- Riviera beauty.
- Local call-girl.

874
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:45,085
- The warrior's rest!
- Right!

875
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:47,044
Hey, the movie quiz!

876
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,756
In what movle
did Jeanne Moreau co-star

877
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:55,879
wlth Orson Welles,
in a Shakespeare film?

878
00:58:56,247 --> 00:58:57,236
"Falstaff"!

879
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,840
Correct.

880
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:01,880
In what movle
was she Charles IX's sister

881
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:03,605
and Henry IV's wlfe?

882
00:59:05,447 --> 00:59:06,357
"Queen Margot"!

883
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:08,438
Rlght.
You know your stuff.

884
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:11,477
Julie, here's tomorrow's scene.

885
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,923
"Yes, I'm in love with you."

886
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,800
"We both knew it
at the costume party."

887
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:37,719
"I can't stay here,
I'm leaving tomorrow."

888
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:27,324
Let's close the window.

889
01:00:27,487 --> 01:00:30,957
Remember...
No sentimentality in this scene.

890
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,197
Play it straight, cold...

891
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:36,006
Almost violent!
The rehearsal was good.

892
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,317
Let's do a take.

893
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:41,566
Lights out! Rain!

894
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:44,640
Less rain!

895
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,725
"Can't you sleep? "

896
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:06,206
"I heard someone.
I knew it was you.

897
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,238
"You can't sleep either? "

898
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:11,204
"I was thinking of you."

899
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:14,642
"You know what's happening to us? "

900
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:18,598
"Yes, I'm in love with you."

901
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,923
"How long have you known? "

902
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:25,920
"We both knew at the costume party.

903
01:01:27,447 --> 01:01:30,598
"I can't stay here,
I'm leaving tomorrow."

904
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:33,040
"I've thought of it, too.

905
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:35,204
"I want us to leave together.

906
01:01:35,367 --> 01:01:38,518
"That would be like running away."

907
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,360
"Yes it would, I know.

908
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,758
"But I don't want to lose you.

909
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:50,084
"Then let's leave now,
like thieves in the night."

910
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,159
Cut! How was it, Walter?

911
01:01:53,327 --> 01:01:56,364
Fine, perfect!
What do we do neXt?

912
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:58,280
We do it again.

913
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:10,956
Llke thleves In the nlght.

914
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:14,124
Llke thleves...

915
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:30,242
We've been looking for you
for an hour!

916
01:02:30,407 --> 01:02:32,841
I was waiting in my dressing-room.

917
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,157
But you were told last night.

918
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:38,922
No, I wasn't!
I didn't get a call-sheet.

919
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:41,078
All right, let's do it now.

920
01:02:42,127 --> 01:02:43,958
The shootlng Is half-flnlshed.

921
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:47,039
Before startlng,
I hope to make a fine movie.

922
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:49,562
The problems begln
and I aim lower!

923
01:02:49,727 --> 01:02:52,400
I hope to make the movle... perlodl

924
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:55,326
Halfway through I say to myself:

925
01:02:55,527 --> 01:02:58,121
"You could've worked harder,
given more.

926
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:00,596
"You can stlll make up for ltl"

927
01:03:00,767 --> 01:03:04,646
And I start trylng harder
to bring the film to life.

928
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:08,245
"Meet Pamela"
is on the right track, now.

929
01:03:08,407 --> 01:03:11,240
The actors are Into thelr roles,
the crew is solid,

930
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:13,875
problems resolved.
Cinema is King!

931
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:27,238
The drinks are on AleXander today!

932
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:32,158
Any champagne left?

933
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:34,841
No, we'll have
to move on to Pernod.

934
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:37,835
Champagne's gone.
You won't get drunk.

935
01:05:38,007 --> 01:05:42,159
Make yourselves at home.
Help yourselves!

936
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:52,000
He's handsome enough
to be in movies.

937
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:54,920
He wants no part of it.

938
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:56,236
He's into tennis.

939
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:04,162
I want to ask you something.

940
01:06:04,967 --> 01:06:07,561
I've decided to adopt Christian.

941
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:10,441
I've always wanted a son.

942
01:06:11,487 --> 01:06:13,125
Maybe I'm silly,

943
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:16,165
but I want someone
to bear my name after I'm gone.

944
01:06:16,487 --> 01:06:17,886
It's a wonderful idea!

945
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:21,079
But there are problems.
Legal ones, I mean.

946
01:06:21,487 --> 01:06:25,719
I'm not married now,
and he hasn't got a French passport.

947
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:27,526
Know what you should do?

948
01:06:28,247 --> 01:06:30,124
Talk to President Lebaille!

949
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:33,757
The electrician's grandfather.

950
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:35,403
Go fish!

951
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:37,797
The cameraman's mother...

952
01:06:40,887 --> 01:06:42,798
Meet Mark Spencer.

953
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:45,525
He's the British stuntman.

954
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:49,159
- Just got here, speaks no French.
- Julie will help.

955
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:54,276
Tell him the car-crash
we're shooting tomorrow

956
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:56,005
will be in "nuit americaine".

957
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,566
What's that?

958
01:06:57,727 --> 01:07:00,036
A night scene shot in daylight

959
01:07:00,207 --> 01:07:01,959
with a special filter.

960
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:15,804
Dressed as she is now.

961
01:07:18,007 --> 01:07:19,235
He didn't understand.

962
01:07:19,407 --> 01:07:21,967
I speak English well,
but don't understand it!

963
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:27,723
Stay here with me this morning.

964
01:07:27,887 --> 01:07:29,366
Are you crazy?

965
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:32,121
Why? What are they shooting today?

966
01:07:32,287 --> 01:07:35,916
Pamela's death.
The stuntman's doing the car-crash.

967
01:07:36,087 --> 01:07:38,237
See? It's not an important scene!

968
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:40,125
I'm late. They're waiting.

969
01:07:40,287 --> 01:07:43,882
Follow me and watch for the arrows!

970
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:51,521
What's this watch?

971
01:07:51,727 --> 01:07:54,639
Pierrot lent it to me.
Mine's being fiXed.

972
01:07:54,807 --> 01:07:56,877
Give it back to him!

973
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:59,515
I'll buy you a watch,
if you need one.

974
01:08:04,327 --> 01:08:06,921
- Making it tough on me?
- Go on...

975
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:09,840
But that's mine. Keep it for me!

976
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:10,996
Sure, I will.

977
01:08:11,527 --> 01:08:13,961
Hurry, guys! Let's move it!

978
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:35,480
What are you doing today?

979
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:36,403
And you?

980
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:39,326
I'm going antique-hunting.

981
01:08:39,607 --> 01:08:40,722
I'll go to a movie.

982
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:24,119
What's the matter?

983
01:09:24,487 --> 01:09:26,284
A damned flat!

984
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:29,566
And you don't know
how to change a tire!

985
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:32,480
Help me!
I'll be late for the shooting.

986
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:36,435
When you're driving,
you don't need a man!

987
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:37,562
We'll be late.

988
01:09:37,767 --> 01:09:39,723
Move! It must be up front.

989
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:42,885
- You've never used a jack?
- I'm not a mechanic!

990
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:46,357
Neither am I!
What if you run out of gas?

991
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:48,279
Then I put some in.

992
01:09:48,447 --> 01:09:50,642
In the carburetor, probably!

993
01:09:50,807 --> 01:09:52,638
There. We're filthy!

994
01:09:53,007 --> 01:09:54,759
I'll change into my sweater.

995
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:00,440
Hold that.

996
01:10:02,847 --> 01:10:04,997
Joelle, if you're in the mood...

997
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:06,123
For what?

998
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:09,160
We're all alone here...

999
01:10:09,647 --> 01:10:11,205
OK, you're on!

1000
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:12,356
What?

1001
01:10:12,527 --> 01:10:16,998
All bark and no bite!
But when it's time for action...

1002
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:18,885
You're willing?

1003
01:10:19,727 --> 01:10:21,718
But we haven't got all day.

1004
01:10:28,247 --> 01:10:29,760
Move it!

1005
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:35,999
So where's Joelle?

1006
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:38,237
She's not here. Neither is Bernard!

1007
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:43,004
A life-size inflatable doll, guys!
For the car!

1008
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:46,080
Or for your bathtub!

1009
01:10:46,247 --> 01:10:49,125
You're lucky he doesn't understand!

1010
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:51,119
He'd slug you!

1011
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:54,006
This isn't slow-motion,
move your asses!

1012
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:58,160
You've all got seX on the brain.
Dirty talk all day long!

1013
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:01,126
Whatcha doing, making a movie?

1014
01:11:01,327 --> 01:11:04,046
You need stars, we're available!

1015
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:06,357
Let the workers through.

1016
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:10,397
We're all farmers, right?

1017
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:14,606
- Right, we're all farmers!
- Funny, you don't look Jewish!

1018
01:11:15,687 --> 01:11:18,759
Heard from your wife and kids,
Pierrot?

1019
01:11:20,247 --> 01:11:23,125
- So you finally got here!
- My car broke down!

1020
01:11:23,287 --> 01:11:26,165
Lucky I left after her, or she'd...

1021
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:29,406
Fill me in.

1022
01:11:31,727 --> 01:11:33,604
Hey, you changed your top.

1023
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,758
Ready to shoot!

1024
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,236
OK, second camera?

1025
01:12:18,087 --> 01:12:19,805
- The stuntman?
- He's done.

1026
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,276
Then he can pack up and leave.

1027
01:12:30,567 --> 01:12:34,082
He promised me a ride,
but he took Liliane instead.

1028
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:35,043
Pretty cool!

1029
01:12:58,567 --> 01:13:00,683
What's all that luggage?

1030
01:13:02,647 --> 01:13:04,638
I might as well tell you.

1031
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:10,881
We're in love.
He's taking me to London.

1032
01:13:11,047 --> 01:13:12,321
The film's not finished!

1033
01:13:12,647 --> 01:13:16,117
They don't need me,
I'm a fifth wheel.

1034
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,845
You can't just quit.

1035
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:20,567
They only hired me
for Alphonse's sake.

1036
01:13:20,847 --> 01:13:22,075
How is he taking this?

1037
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:24,966
He'll get the surprise tonight.

1038
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,759
He'll be terribly upset!

1039
01:13:27,007 --> 01:13:29,157
He's always terribly upset.

1040
01:13:29,327 --> 01:13:31,716
He's a spoiled brat
who won't grow up.

1041
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,516
He loves you
and wants to marry you.

1042
01:13:34,927 --> 01:13:37,202
He mentioned marriage, I didn't!

1043
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:39,597
Just the word gives me the creeps.

1044
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:42,156
Anyway, he needs a wife, a mistress,

1045
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:44,961
a nanny, a nurse, a sister...

1046
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:47,243
I can't play all those roles!

1047
01:13:47,447 --> 01:13:50,803
You're being cruel,
and don't even realize it.

1048
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:53,282
I'm through with Alphonse!

1049
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:58,322
He wants the whole world
to pay for his unhappy childhood!

1050
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:05,961
Julie, come get in the photo!

1051
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:09,196
What photo?

1052
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:13,121
A souvenir for me. It's my last day!

1053
01:14:15,647 --> 01:14:17,956
Wait. Here comes Stacey.

1054
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:30,201
Come on, Stacey.
We're proud of you!

1055
01:14:30,367 --> 01:14:33,598
Stand there.
Looks like it's due soon.

1056
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:35,565
And it's not even twins!

1057
01:14:36,287 --> 01:14:37,356
Lucky girl!

1058
01:14:38,127 --> 01:14:40,687
All her shots
will be close-ups now!

1059
01:14:42,407 --> 01:14:43,442
Don't move!

1060
01:14:44,087 --> 01:14:47,204
Wait! We're missing Liliane!
Where is she?

1061
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,517
I have to talk to you.

1062
01:14:53,727 --> 01:14:55,479
Liliane won't be coming...

1063
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,963
She was right to leave.

1064
01:15:13,167 --> 01:15:15,920
I understand,
it had to end this way.

1065
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:18,483
Don't move!

1066
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:20,877
Now Alphonse has disappeared!

1067
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,200
And where's Odile?

1068
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:31,447
Liliane ran off with the stuntman.

1069
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,359
Does Alphonse know?

1070
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:35,518
I had to tell him.

1071
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,399
With the stuntman!

1072
01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:41,156
I'd drop a guy for a film.
I'd never drop a film for a guy!

1073
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:43,726
Can you manage?

1074
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:46,922
I'll eXplain...

1075
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:52,365
We built this to convey that
you live across from your in-laws.

1076
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:58,078
I'll cue you,
as Alphonse isn't here.

1077
01:17:58,247 --> 01:17:59,885
He's in love,
so we're in a pickle!

1078
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:03,198
Good title: "The Pickles of Love".

1079
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,485
"Rise and shine, kids! "

1080
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,317
"Come have breakfast with us! "

1081
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:15,761
"Alphonse is in bed."

1082
01:18:15,927 --> 01:18:17,360
NeXt line, Julie!

1083
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,245
"We're invited over."

1084
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:22,405
"We'll be right there."

1085
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:23,920
Cut! Once more!

1086
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:29,721
"Come have breakfast with us! "

1087
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,366
"Alphonse is asleep."

1088
01:18:31,527 --> 01:18:33,358
No, no..."in bed! "

1089
01:18:33,567 --> 01:18:35,398
"We're invited over."

1090
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,324
I know you're in there!
Open up. Everyone's asking for you.

1091
01:19:47,487 --> 01:19:48,636
They are not!

1092
01:19:48,807 --> 01:19:51,037
Severine leaves for Italy tonight.

1093
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:54,085
I don't want to see anyone!

1094
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:58,839
This actor had always dreamed
of playing Hamlet.

1095
01:19:59,007 --> 01:19:59,757
At last

1096
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:02,202
he staged it and played the role!

1097
01:20:02,767 --> 01:20:05,804
But he was so bad,
he was booed every night.

1098
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,606
One night he was fed up,

1099
01:20:08,807 --> 01:20:13,437
he stopped in the middle
of "To be or not to be..."

1100
01:20:13,607 --> 01:20:16,963
Turning to the audience, he said:

1101
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:27,806
The champagne, at last!

1102
01:20:28,047 --> 01:20:30,686
You still have to finish "Pamela"!

1103
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:33,998
I'm so sad to be leaving.

1104
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:35,839
Come join us, machos!

1105
01:20:36,007 --> 01:20:39,079
Move your table!

1106
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:43,403
Why are you all alone over there?

1107
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:46,001
Are you sad, in love, heartbroken?

1108
01:20:47,287 --> 01:20:49,357
Don't! He's a just hotel guest.

1109
01:20:49,527 --> 01:20:51,006
So what?

1110
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:53,635
Come join us, Mr Hotel Guest!

1111
01:20:54,687 --> 01:20:57,963
We're a movie crew
having a farewell party.

1112
01:20:58,127 --> 01:20:59,799
I'll introduce you.

1113
01:21:11,607 --> 01:21:13,040
Can I talk to you?

1114
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:18,482
I think we should get Alphonse.

1115
01:21:18,647 --> 01:21:22,162
He's locked in his room, sulking!
He's a drag.

1116
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:23,521
That's unfair.

1117
01:21:23,727 --> 01:21:26,799
I've known him for ages.
Never fails!

1118
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:28,366
Then I'll go.

1119
01:21:28,527 --> 01:21:30,040
I'll try again.

1120
01:21:30,207 --> 01:21:33,165
Come see the great photos!

1121
01:21:36,327 --> 01:21:37,680
She's so cute...

1122
01:21:37,847 --> 01:21:38,962
She's not! Out!

1123
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:47,280
What a funny life we lead!

1124
01:21:48,447 --> 01:21:51,439
We meet, we work together...

1125
01:21:52,047 --> 01:21:53,639
We love each other, and then...

1126
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:56,486
As soon as we grasp something...

1127
01:21:57,687 --> 01:22:00,201
It's gone! See?

1128
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:04,281
Severine is eXtraordinary.

1129
01:22:04,447 --> 01:22:06,483
We made a film together in Italy.

1130
01:22:06,647 --> 01:22:09,764
She was so good,
the director kept saying:

1131
01:22:10,207 --> 01:22:12,880
"She's greater than Eleanora Duse! "

1132
01:22:13,047 --> 01:22:15,880
So I called her Superduse!

1133
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:26,526
Seen Alphonse?

1134
01:22:26,687 --> 01:22:29,963
He's locked in and won't come out.

1135
01:22:30,847 --> 01:22:32,644
Well, Severine's gone, so...

1136
01:22:36,727 --> 01:22:39,366
I need money to go to a whorehouse.

1137
01:22:39,847 --> 01:22:41,724
Come on, Alphonse.

1138
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:45,046
Go back to your room,
re-read the script,

1139
01:22:45,207 --> 01:22:47,402
learn your lines,
then try to sleep.

1140
01:22:47,567 --> 01:22:50,206
Tomorrow we work.
That's what matters.

1141
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:52,116
Don't be a fool.

1142
01:22:53,287 --> 01:22:55,118
You're a very good actor.

1143
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:58,245
No one's private life runs smoothly.

1144
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:00,398
That only happens in the movies.

1145
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:02,717
No traffic jams, no dead periods.

1146
01:23:02,887 --> 01:23:05,799
Movies go along like trains
in the night.

1147
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:07,685
And people like you and me

1148
01:23:07,847 --> 01:23:10,520
are only happy in our work.

1149
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:12,680
I'm counting on you.

1150
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:20,962
"Which costume
shall I choose for Saturday? "

1151
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:35,438
Swltch the call from for 227 to 41+5.

1152
01:23:41,127 --> 01:23:42,719
It's Alphonse.

1153
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:45,561
I wanted to tell you
I'm leaving tonight.

1154
01:23:45,727 --> 01:23:49,436
You've always been my frlend.
Tell Ferrand for me.

1155
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:52,075
I have to talk to you. Wait!

1156
01:23:52,247 --> 01:23:53,475
Goodbye and thanks.

1157
01:23:53,647 --> 01:23:54,841
Wait for me!

1158
01:24:13,087 --> 01:24:15,999
What is all this? You can't leave.

1159
01:24:16,767 --> 01:24:19,122
I am, I'm giving it all up.

1160
01:24:19,407 --> 01:24:22,080
You'll stay and finish the film.

1161
01:24:22,527 --> 01:24:25,439
Even if I stayed,
I'm too upset to work!

1162
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,438
I'm a physical wreck.

1163
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:30,279
Is it normal for someone

1164
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:33,559
to stop loving you
and just walk out?

1165
01:24:33,727 --> 01:24:35,877
Then it was all phony,
sickening!

1166
01:24:36,367 --> 01:24:40,076
I know how much
you've been hurt.

1167
01:24:40,287 --> 01:24:42,482
But I think Liliane still loves you.

1168
01:24:43,127 --> 01:24:45,436
You're being selfish, too.

1169
01:24:45,687 --> 01:24:47,279
You know it's difficult

1170
01:24:47,487 --> 01:24:50,285
for an outsider
to live with an actor.

1171
01:24:50,487 --> 01:24:54,878
But to leave with just anyone!
Some Brit stuntman!

1172
01:24:55,287 --> 01:24:57,517
Careful! I'm a Brit, too.

1173
01:24:57,807 --> 01:25:00,002
And I know those stuntmen.

1174
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:03,523
You know
what'll happen to their affair.

1175
01:25:04,647 --> 01:25:08,242
At first, he'll take her
everywhere with him.

1176
01:25:08,407 --> 01:25:11,319
Then he'll get bored
and she'll feel lost

1177
01:25:11,527 --> 01:25:13,199
all alone in London.

1178
01:25:13,367 --> 01:25:15,676
She'll be back in 2 weeks.

1179
01:25:15,887 --> 01:25:16,524
Think so?

1180
01:25:17,527 --> 01:25:21,156
Anyway, it's over now.
I'd rather suffer.

1181
01:25:22,927 --> 01:25:26,317
You see,
I've made a terrible discovery.

1182
01:25:26,767 --> 01:25:29,839
You can be desperately in love

1183
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:31,640
with someone you despise.

1184
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:35,163
Whose every gesture,
word and thought you detest!

1185
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:38,126
What right have you to say that?

1186
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:39,879
Say you made a mistake,

1187
01:25:40,087 --> 01:25:42,647
but never be ashamed
of having loved!

1188
01:25:43,367 --> 01:25:46,279
By despising Liliane
you're merely...

1189
01:25:46,647 --> 01:25:47,841
degrading yourself.

1190
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:49,999
Maybe you're right.

1191
01:25:50,287 --> 01:25:53,757
Anyway, my love-affairs
have always ended badly.

1192
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:55,925
I thought women were magic.

1193
01:25:56,127 --> 01:25:59,836
Of course they're not magic.
Or men are, too.

1194
01:26:00,007 --> 01:26:02,157
Everyone's magic, and no one is.

1195
01:26:03,647 --> 01:26:07,526
I'm sure Ferrand is wrong.
Life is more important than films.

1196
01:26:07,687 --> 01:26:09,882
I'm going now. Thank you.

1197
01:26:10,047 --> 01:26:11,116
Don't be a fool.

1198
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:14,035
Stay and finish your work.

1199
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:33,600
Is that clock working?

1200
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,125
It's 6 A. M! Time to make coffee!

1201
01:26:55,207 --> 01:26:57,084
Have you seen Julie?

1202
01:26:57,247 --> 01:26:59,078
I'm looking for Lajoie!

1203
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:00,839
Know what that idiot did?

1204
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:04,443
MiXed up his dates
and sent the costumes back!

1205
01:27:04,607 --> 01:27:06,518
So you've been up for hours?

1206
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:10,123
All night, getting the costumes
from the airport.

1207
01:27:10,287 --> 01:27:11,845
Or no shooting today!

1208
01:27:12,007 --> 01:27:14,441
Where could Julie be?

1209
01:27:14,607 --> 01:27:15,926
In her room?

1210
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:18,362
Her bed hasn't been slept in.

1211
01:27:18,527 --> 01:27:21,325
Everyone's nuts on this movie!

1212
01:27:48,767 --> 01:27:50,883
- What time is it?
- 6 AM.

1213
01:27:51,087 --> 01:27:53,237
- Where you going?
- To work.

1214
01:27:54,087 --> 01:27:57,477
You can sleep 2 more hours,
I set the alarm.

1215
01:27:58,567 --> 01:27:59,761
Stay with me.

1216
01:27:59,927 --> 01:28:01,406
I can't.

1217
01:28:03,767 --> 01:28:06,998
I have a make-up call
for the costume party scene.

1218
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:08,561
Wait!

1219
01:28:09,487 --> 01:28:10,886
Kiss me.

1220
01:28:14,807 --> 01:28:16,081
You won't forget?

1221
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:19,398
We'll go away together
when the film's done.

1222
01:28:20,447 --> 01:28:21,926
Sleep.

1223
01:29:10,567 --> 01:29:13,240
Dr Nelson? It's Alphonse.

1224
01:29:15,247 --> 01:29:16,839
I have something to tell you.

1225
01:29:17,007 --> 01:29:20,795
I love your wife.
I slept with her. Set her free!

1226
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:37,046
Julie, call for you.

1227
01:29:37,207 --> 01:29:38,959
I think it's your husband.

1228
01:30:01,727 --> 01:30:04,082
- You owe me for this bill!
- Not now!

1229
01:30:04,247 --> 01:30:05,680
Later it'll be too late!

1230
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:09,078
You looked everywhere?
He's not in his room?

1231
01:30:10,727 --> 01:30:13,958
Alphonse has disappeared!

1232
01:30:15,087 --> 01:30:16,839
Could he have gone to Paris?

1233
01:30:17,007 --> 01:30:19,965
There are flights at 8:50 and 10:10.

1234
01:30:20,127 --> 01:30:21,640
Call the airport.

1235
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:23,877
You call, I'll go.

1236
01:30:24,047 --> 01:30:26,402
If he's there, I'll bring him back.

1237
01:30:30,127 --> 01:30:32,880
- We've got trouble!
- I know, Alphonse is gone.

1238
01:30:33,047 --> 01:30:35,481
I mean Julie! Nerves, I guess.

1239
01:30:35,647 --> 01:30:38,480
She locked herself in,
won't see anyone.

1240
01:30:38,647 --> 01:30:40,080
You can hear her crying.

1241
01:30:40,927 --> 01:30:43,077
I hope it's not another breakdown!

1242
01:30:43,247 --> 01:30:44,680
Let's go see.

1243
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:46,759
There's Odile.

1244
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:50,317
She got a call from Dr Nelson,
I think.

1245
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:53,445
She asked me to leave,
and locked the door.

1246
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:55,040
It's me, open the door!

1247
01:30:55,207 --> 01:30:57,562
Open up, we're your friends!

1248
01:30:57,727 --> 01:30:59,683
As producer, I want to help you.

1249
01:30:59,847 --> 01:31:01,166
Quiet!

1250
01:31:01,647 --> 01:31:03,478
You don't think she'd...

1251
01:31:06,047 --> 01:31:09,039
- Will she talk to you?
- She won't open the door.

1252
01:31:09,207 --> 01:31:11,357
You can hear her crying.

1253
01:31:19,847 --> 01:31:23,476
She keeps us out,
and lets Stacey in!

1254
01:31:23,647 --> 01:31:26,207
Motherhood has its privileges.

1255
01:31:27,087 --> 01:31:30,796
We can't find Alphonse anywhere.

1256
01:31:31,087 --> 01:31:33,317
Julie didn't sleep in her room.

1257
01:31:33,487 --> 01:31:36,763
Alphonse disappears,
Dr Nelson calls.

1258
01:31:36,927 --> 01:31:38,599
The picture's pretty clear!

1259
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:42,041
What is this movie business?

1260
01:31:42,207 --> 01:31:44,721
Where everyone sleeps with everyone!

1261
01:31:44,967 --> 01:31:45,797
Everyone lies!

1262
01:31:46,007 --> 01:31:49,204
Do you think it's normal?
Your movie world...

1263
01:31:50,167 --> 01:31:51,680
I think it stinks!

1264
01:31:51,927 --> 01:31:52,962
I despise it!

1265
01:31:53,127 --> 01:31:55,880
Lajoie, calm your wife down!

1266
01:32:02,487 --> 01:32:04,045
That woman's wrong.

1267
01:32:04,207 --> 01:32:07,324
Movie people may be
more obvious about it,

1268
01:32:07,487 --> 01:32:09,239
but love makes
the world go round!

1269
01:32:10,287 --> 01:32:12,517
She wants tub butter.

1270
01:32:12,807 --> 01:32:15,037
Country butter, in bulk.

1271
01:32:15,207 --> 01:32:17,323
Is she crazy? What's she doing?

1272
01:32:17,487 --> 01:32:22,003
Crying. She'll stop,
but find her some tub butter!

1273
01:32:23,967 --> 01:32:25,685
Find some tub butter.

1274
01:32:25,847 --> 01:32:28,441
No way! It's not in the script!

1275
01:32:28,607 --> 01:32:30,563
That's not nice, or friendly!

1276
01:32:30,727 --> 01:32:32,399
Aren't we one big family?

1277
01:32:32,567 --> 01:32:34,603
So were the people
in Greek tragedies!

1278
01:32:34,767 --> 01:32:37,600
Tub butter!
All right, I'll find it myself.

1279
01:32:39,647 --> 01:32:41,763
He's really quite lucky.

1280
01:32:41,927 --> 01:32:43,918
Some whims are more eXpensive!

1281
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:46,998
There was an Austrian actress,

1282
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:48,361
Hedy Lamarr,

1283
01:32:48,527 --> 01:32:50,324
became a big Hollywood star.

1284
01:32:50,887 --> 01:32:55,563
She really missed the rainy climate
of her native Tyrol.

1285
01:32:55,847 --> 01:32:59,237
So, in her garden in California,
she installed

1286
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:02,247
a rain-making machine.

1287
01:33:02,567 --> 01:33:05,525
So a little thing like tub butter...

1288
01:33:06,727 --> 01:33:09,799
Come help me!
This is all I could find.

1289
01:33:09,967 --> 01:33:11,116
That's not it!

1290
01:33:11,287 --> 01:33:13,881
There's no tub butter
on the whole Riviera!

1291
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:16,686
So we'll knead this
into one block...

1292
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:20,601
wrap it in gauze,
and it'll look like it!

1293
01:33:21,607 --> 01:33:22,926
Think it'll work?

1294
01:33:23,087 --> 01:33:24,645
It has to.
What a business!

1295
01:33:28,287 --> 01:33:30,676
I found Alphonse. Where?

1296
01:33:30,847 --> 01:33:33,315
You'll never guess!
I'll bring him in.

1297
01:33:45,767 --> 01:33:47,200
There you are!

1298
01:33:47,367 --> 01:33:51,155
Here's the famous tub butter.
I won't deliver it!

1299
01:33:51,527 --> 01:33:53,802
No! Like the chef
in "Rules Of The Game",

1300
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,845
"I cater to diets, but not fads! "

1301
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:14,878
Here's what you asked for.

1302
01:34:15,967 --> 01:34:17,400
You didn't!

1303
01:34:20,007 --> 01:34:20,803
Forgive me.

1304
01:34:21,567 --> 01:34:23,205
I'm so ashamed!

1305
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:26,481
I'll be all right in a minute.

1306
01:34:27,047 --> 01:34:29,436
I know it's not very professional.

1307
01:34:29,687 --> 01:34:33,441
I don't like being like this,
holding you up.

1308
01:34:33,807 --> 01:34:37,004
It's all right, we can wait awhile.

1309
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:38,885
We'll change the schedule.

1310
01:34:39,287 --> 01:34:42,120
Don't change it because of me!

1311
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:45,916
I'll be all right in a minute.

1312
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:50,524
Can you lend me a handkerchief?

1313
01:34:52,727 --> 01:34:54,479
I must look awful.

1314
01:34:57,967 --> 01:35:01,596
Why did Alphonse do it?
He didn't understand anything!

1315
01:35:01,807 --> 01:35:04,116
He acted like the child he is.

1316
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:06,323
I saw enough of your husband

1317
01:35:06,487 --> 01:35:09,399
to know he's a wonderful man.

1318
01:35:09,567 --> 01:35:11,159
Yes, he is.

1319
01:35:11,647 --> 01:35:13,797
But you don't know the whole story.

1320
01:35:16,047 --> 01:35:18,641
When I had my breakdown,

1321
01:35:18,807 --> 01:35:20,923
he did a very serious thing.

1322
01:35:21,087 --> 01:35:23,317
He left his wife and children.

1323
01:35:24,487 --> 01:35:28,446
He gave up a life
it took him 20 years to create.

1324
01:35:28,847 --> 01:35:30,041
He did that for me.

1325
01:35:30,247 --> 01:35:32,841
He devoted himself to me.

1326
01:35:33,007 --> 01:35:36,044
He tried to make me
into a responsible adult.

1327
01:35:36,407 --> 01:35:41,117
Now he must think
it was an awful waste.

1328
01:35:41,287 --> 01:35:44,279
No, when he knows what happened,

1329
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:47,200
he'll understand.
He'll forget, it'll be over.

1330
01:35:48,127 --> 01:35:49,082
You think so?

1331
01:35:49,367 --> 01:35:53,246
Even if that's true,
I'll never forget...

1332
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:54,836
Thanks to him,

1333
01:35:55,047 --> 01:35:56,844
I know I can change my life.

1334
01:35:57,967 --> 01:36:03,121
I've decided to live alone.
I'm sick of disguises.

1335
01:36:03,287 --> 01:36:05,005
I'm quitting movies.

1336
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:07,044
I know that life is rotten.

1337
01:36:09,607 --> 01:36:12,997
Since we can't shoot,
we'll record some wild tracks.

1338
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:15,920
- Ready, RenÈ?
- OK. Applause first.

1339
01:36:22,407 --> 01:36:24,204
Now some background talk.

1340
01:36:25,287 --> 01:36:26,720
Don't discuss movies!

1341
01:36:32,967 --> 01:36:34,241
Now more applause.

1342
01:36:49,087 --> 01:36:51,920
Julie's dressing-room
is upstairs-right.

1343
01:36:54,847 --> 01:36:58,635
I called him and he agreed to come!

1344
01:37:16,167 --> 01:37:18,283
I really screwed up.

1345
01:37:18,807 --> 01:37:21,560
What can I say to Julie
when I see her?

1346
01:37:21,727 --> 01:37:26,039
- Should I apologize?
- The less said, the better.

1347
01:37:27,807 --> 01:37:30,958
I've made up my mind.
I'm quitting movies.

1348
01:37:31,127 --> 01:37:33,641
That's a good idea, you do that!

1349
01:37:39,367 --> 01:37:41,198
Are you seeing Julie?

1350
01:37:41,367 --> 01:37:44,643
Give her this new dialogue
for the scene.

1351
01:37:44,927 --> 01:37:46,360
She's to learn it.

1352
01:38:22,687 --> 01:38:25,520
Can I fiX your make-up now?

1353
01:38:28,407 --> 01:38:32,161
I'm fine now.
We'll make ourselves beautiful!

1354
01:38:38,327 --> 01:38:42,445
This is your new dialogue
for the scene.

1355
01:38:46,247 --> 01:38:50,240
"Even if that's true,
I'll never forget...

1356
01:38:50,807 --> 01:38:53,367
"I've decided to live alone.

1357
01:38:53,527 --> 01:38:55,438
"I know that life is rotten."

1358
01:38:55,607 --> 01:38:57,723
He's got some nerve!

1359
01:38:59,807 --> 01:39:01,320
Are you all right, Julie?

1360
01:39:01,487 --> 01:39:02,761
Let's do it!

1361
01:39:04,767 --> 01:39:07,520
"I've decided to live alone.

1362
01:39:08,127 --> 01:39:09,879
"I know that life is rotten."

1363
01:39:10,047 --> 01:39:12,686
"No, it isn't."

1364
01:39:47,887 --> 01:39:50,162
Cut! Once more, for the hands.

1365
01:39:50,367 --> 01:39:51,766
The candle okay?

1366
01:39:53,207 --> 01:39:56,756
- Places.
- Places, and quiet please!

1367
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:02,925
I'll caress her with this hand.

1368
01:40:03,807 --> 01:40:05,445
Places.

1369
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:08,405
And let's do it.

1370
01:40:18,287 --> 01:40:21,324
"I've decided to live alone.

1371
01:40:21,527 --> 01:40:23,438
"I know that life is rotten."

1372
01:40:23,607 --> 01:40:25,484
"No, it isn't."

1373
01:41:03,407 --> 01:41:05,875
Cut. That was the best one!

1374
01:41:06,207 --> 01:41:07,526
AleXander is dead!

1375
01:41:09,607 --> 01:41:12,121
A car accident.
Returning from the airport,

1376
01:41:12,287 --> 01:41:14,357
where went to meet Christian.

1377
01:41:15,127 --> 01:41:16,924
A truck hit their car.

1378
01:41:18,047 --> 01:41:21,323
Christian is badly hurt,
but he'll recover.

1379
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:23,840
AleXander died...

1380
01:41:24,647 --> 01:41:26,638
on the way to the hospital.

1381
01:41:29,847 --> 01:41:33,317
Alexander was burled
in a little cemetery above Nice.

1382
01:41:33,487 --> 01:41:37,719
Now the fllm's fate was In the hands
of the English insurers.

1383
01:41:38,207 --> 01:41:40,926
What I always feared had happened:

1384
01:41:41,087 --> 01:41:43,282
a productlon halted by death.

1385
01:41:45,327 --> 01:41:48,080
The era of studlo movles
died with AleXander.

1386
01:41:48,247 --> 01:41:52,240
Fllms wlll be shot In the streets,
without stars, or scripts.

1387
01:41:52,407 --> 01:41:55,285
There wlll be no more fllms
like "Meet Pamela".

1388
01:42:09,247 --> 01:42:10,646
"Hello, Pamela! "

1389
01:42:10,807 --> 01:42:13,275
"Come have breakfast with us! "

1390
01:42:13,447 --> 01:42:14,880
"Alphonse is still asleep! "

1391
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:16,685
No..."in bed? "

1392
01:42:17,087 --> 01:42:18,486
"We're invited over."

1393
01:42:19,647 --> 01:42:21,319
"We'll be right there."

1394
01:42:21,487 --> 01:42:23,876
- Was that OK?
- Fine. Cut!

1395
01:42:24,247 --> 01:42:25,999
Wait, I'm coming over!

1396
01:42:31,007 --> 01:42:33,441
I was afraid
he might have an accident.

1397
01:42:33,607 --> 01:42:35,837
I offered him a driver.

1398
01:42:36,687 --> 01:42:40,441
He wasn't at home anywhere.

1399
01:42:40,967 --> 01:42:45,006
Always rushing off somewhere.
A man in a hurry.

1400
01:42:45,447 --> 01:42:47,642
No, he was at home everywhere.

1401
01:42:47,807 --> 01:42:50,116
He liked people,
he lived for the moment.

1402
01:42:50,287 --> 01:42:52,118
He couldn't leave places.

1403
01:42:52,287 --> 01:42:55,279
He was rushing back not to be late.

1404
01:42:55,447 --> 01:42:58,439
You could say,
he died out of generosity.

1405
01:42:58,607 --> 01:43:00,006
You may be right.

1406
01:43:01,087 --> 01:43:03,317
Now we have to finish the film.

1407
01:43:04,567 --> 01:43:07,877
What does
the insurance company say?

1408
01:43:23,087 --> 01:43:26,477
Mr Johanson talked at length
to London last night.

1409
01:43:26,647 --> 01:43:31,323
You can't re-shoot AleXander's
scenes with another actor.

1410
01:43:31,487 --> 01:43:34,160
The only solution
is to simplify the script

1411
01:43:34,327 --> 01:43:37,603
and finish shooting
in 5 days instead of 2 weeks.

1412
01:43:37,807 --> 01:43:40,275
Then the insurance
will cover everything.

1413
01:43:40,527 --> 01:43:41,801
5 days!

1414
01:43:42,767 --> 01:43:44,200
We'll have to simplify things.

1415
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:48,918
We'll leave AleXander
out of the costume party scene.

1416
01:43:49,087 --> 01:43:53,444
Then the shot with the candles
makes no sense any more.

1417
01:43:54,007 --> 01:43:58,444
We'll cut the costume party scene.
The story works without it.

1418
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:03,635
Then the only important scene left,
is when Alphonse kills his father.

1419
01:44:03,807 --> 01:44:08,881
We can shoot it in the street,
and hire a stand-in for AleXander.

1420
01:44:09,047 --> 01:44:13,040
It won't work, unless Alphonse
shoots him in the back.

1421
01:44:13,367 --> 01:44:15,597
Why not? In the back!

1422
01:44:15,767 --> 01:44:17,962
It's better, far more violent.

1423
01:44:18,207 --> 01:44:21,324
Why not have it all take place
in the snow?

1424
01:44:51,887 --> 01:44:53,161
All right, Walter.

1425
01:44:53,327 --> 01:44:55,283
Just like last time.

1426
01:44:55,567 --> 01:44:58,957
But we'll be closer
on Alphonse this time.

1427
01:44:59,607 --> 01:45:02,440
But we have to see the gun.

1428
01:45:02,607 --> 01:45:04,962
Here's the stand-in.

1429
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:10,364
Could you walk away?
We have to see how you look.

1430
01:45:11,087 --> 01:45:12,679
Too much hair on the neck.

1431
01:45:12,847 --> 01:45:14,599
It has to work!

1432
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:17,076
That's AleXander's stand-in.

1433
01:45:17,247 --> 01:45:20,523
Trim his hair more like AleXander's.

1434
01:45:21,327 --> 01:45:24,956
This is the gun you wanted
for Alphonse, right?

1435
01:45:25,127 --> 01:45:27,482
If that's the one I chose, sure.

1436
01:45:30,287 --> 01:45:33,324
Places, everybody. Hurry!

1437
01:45:36,167 --> 01:45:38,601
Hurry, please!
To the places I showed you!

1438
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:44,084
I don't want the snow
too white, or too clean.

1439
01:45:44,247 --> 01:45:48,001
Don't worry, I'll fiX it
like in "The Snow Was Black".

1440
01:45:50,727 --> 01:45:54,481
I've been offered a movie in Tokyo.
I want to accept.

1441
01:45:54,647 --> 01:45:57,445
Turgenev's "First Love",
a good story.

1442
01:45:57,607 --> 01:45:59,006
For a movie?

1443
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:02,603
With a Japanese girl
and you as the Frenchman, sure!

1444
01:46:02,767 --> 01:46:06,806
I'll do it because it's Tokyo.
13,000 miles from my problems!

1445
01:46:06,967 --> 01:46:11,085
Should I hold the gun like this?
Or like that?

1446
01:46:11,287 --> 01:46:13,755
Like that.
So it's seen against the snow.

1447
01:46:14,367 --> 01:46:17,359
Dr Nelson and Julie
want to say goodbye.

1448
01:46:17,647 --> 01:46:21,003
- Off to London?
- Australia! A medical conference.

1449
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:23,727
Be ready to shoot when I get back!

1450
01:46:29,807 --> 01:46:33,117
See you in Paris for the post-synch!

1451
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:42,363
Let's go before it gets dark!

1452
01:46:57,247 --> 01:46:58,077
Good luck.

1453
01:46:58,287 --> 01:46:59,163
You, too.

1454
01:47:24,167 --> 01:47:25,759
More discreetly!

1455
01:47:30,647 --> 01:47:32,080
Walk faster!

1456
01:47:36,687 --> 01:47:38,040
The gun!

1457
01:47:40,567 --> 01:47:42,046
Run away!

1458
01:47:43,327 --> 01:47:45,158
Run to the far end!

1459
01:48:11,887 --> 01:48:12,603
Cut!

1460
01:48:13,687 --> 01:48:15,882
Shooting's over! Thanks, everyone!

1461
01:48:28,927 --> 01:48:30,201
Going back to Paris?

1462
01:48:30,367 --> 01:48:32,801
No, I'm staying around here
for a rest.

1463
01:48:32,967 --> 01:48:34,639
Have a nice rest.

1464
01:48:35,847 --> 01:48:38,441
My car was wrecked in the stunt.

1465
01:48:38,607 --> 01:48:42,236
I've got another one in Paris,
but I need a ride.

1466
01:48:42,407 --> 01:48:45,922
With me? Impossible!
It's full of my gear.

1467
01:48:46,087 --> 01:48:48,282
Anyway, I like to be independent!

1468
01:48:49,287 --> 01:48:51,118
Yann, wait for me!

1469
01:48:52,487 --> 01:48:54,000
See you in the bread line!

1470
01:48:54,167 --> 01:48:55,680
Unemployment, here we come!

1471
01:48:58,367 --> 01:49:00,676
I'm taking Odile to meet my folks.

1472
01:49:00,847 --> 01:49:02,405
We're getting married.

1473
01:49:02,567 --> 01:49:04,717
Well, very cagey of you!

1474
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:06,805
I bet no one suspected.

1475
01:49:06,967 --> 01:49:10,164
She's eXperienced and I'm not.
A happy medium!

1476
01:49:10,607 --> 01:49:12,802
All the best, congratulations.

1477
01:49:16,327 --> 01:49:18,557
And thanks. Great camera work!

1478
01:49:18,727 --> 01:49:19,716
Glad you like it.

1479
01:49:19,967 --> 01:49:22,037
'Bye, kids! Have a nice trip.

1480
01:49:23,447 --> 01:49:25,756
Drive carefully!

1481
01:49:26,167 --> 01:49:28,681
Could you talk to us
about AleXander?

1482
01:49:28,847 --> 01:49:32,317
No, it's too personal.
Ask Bertrand, the producer.

1483
01:49:32,487 --> 01:49:33,476
He refused.

1484
01:49:33,647 --> 01:49:35,877
- Alphonse?
- He won't talk about death!

1485
01:49:36,047 --> 01:49:37,275
Sorry...

1486
01:49:37,687 --> 01:49:39,962
I'll talk to you!

1487
01:49:42,527 --> 01:49:43,960
Got him framed?

1488
01:49:44,127 --> 01:49:46,322
- Who's he?
- Props, I think.

1489
01:49:47,287 --> 01:49:49,801
Wasn't it a hard film to make?

1490
01:49:49,967 --> 01:49:52,606
Lots of trouble during the shooting?

1491
01:49:52,767 --> 01:49:54,678
Not at all! It went fine!

1492
01:49:54,847 --> 01:49:56,678
And we hope audiences

1493
01:49:56,847 --> 01:49:59,645
enjoy seeing it
as much as we enjoyed making it!

1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,700
Last night I relived our story.
Some day I'll write it

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,700
Muriel thinks it might help others

3
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,000
mother...

4
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
well, Claude?

5
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
I was waiting for you

6
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,900
can't you introduce yourself?

7
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Mother's spoken of you

8
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
and of you, too

9
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
do you like Paris?

10
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,500
Yes, I find that...

11
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Paris is...
I like the Parisians

12
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,500
and the English?

13
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
They're less lively,
less open...

14
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,800
but logical and imaginative
in their way

15
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,300
you're not shocked by the french?

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Not shocked, but surprised

17
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,700
they lie more than we do...

18
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
but once you know the odds,
it's fine

19
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
so you've met?

20
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
A pity that Claude...

21
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,300
isn't well enough to show you Paris

22
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,700
but come see us often

23
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
you two should speak English

24
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,400
Claude needs the practice

25
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
she raised her veil. Claude thought
of chaste and pleasing nudity

26
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,600
he noted in his diary...

27
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,000
that she was his age
and seemed sensitive yet sensible

28
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,100
their mothers had been
childhood friends

29
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
Anne visited Claude often

30
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,500
they exchanged books and ideas...

31
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,300
with the ease of old friends

32
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Anne wanted to be a sculptress

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,500
she "discovered" Rodin,
then unknown in England

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Anne spoke of a sister,
Muriel... 2 years younger...

35
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,300
she found a photo of Muriel,
aged ten...

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,600
round face, prim mouth,
clear brow...

37
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,400
and a shy, untamed look

38
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
"come see her," Anne said

39
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,100
"I'd like to hear you two talk"

40
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
you don't need that any more

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,100
give it to me!

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
So Claude went to visit
the browns in Wales

43
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
his mother raised no objections

44
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,100
what's going on?

45
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,500
It's our neighbour, Mr flint...

46
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,900
his boat was stolen today

47
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,000
he refuses to sign a complaint

48
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,200
he says the thief's need is greater

49
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,700
admirable!

50
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,100
A rare attitude around here

51
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,200
I'll show you the house

52
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,200
I share this room with Muriel...

53
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,700
and that's our mother's room

54
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,600
here's your room

55
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,700
very nice

56
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,400
- I'll help you.
- Very pretty

57
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
unpack... you'll meet mother later

58
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
you'll see Muriel tonight

59
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,300
Claude felt Mrs brown's reserve

60
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,000
Anne had talked about him...

61
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,700
but Mrs brown would judge
for herself

62
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,300
Muriel did not join them

63
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
she'd strained her eyes

64
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,300
they ate almost in silence

65
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Claude stared at the empty chair...

66
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,100
Muriel's chair

67
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
the next day they took easels...

68
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,900
and went to the cliff to paint

69
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,700
what a pity Muriel can't be here!

70
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,500
Dinner's ready

71
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm coming

72
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
Muriel's dining with us...

73
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,900
but don't look at her yet

74
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,600
Anne's spoken of you

75
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
and about you, too

76
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,700
good trip?

77
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,100
Fine. I wasn't even seasick

78
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,500
"I wasn't even seasick!"
You sounded like a little boy

79
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,200
as a child, Muriel would come
from the dentist...

80
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,000
and we'd ask if it hurt.
She'd say:

81
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,400
"No, and I didn't even cry"

82
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,100
dear mother...
I finally met Muriel

83
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
she's smaller than Anne,
with red hair

84
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,200
her eyes are bandaged

85
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
she lifts one edge to see her plate

86
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
her voice is low and husky

87
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
it matches her shy, untamed look

88
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,500
her hands are soft to look at

89
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,900
have Anne and Muriel deserted you?

90
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
Anne's working
and Muriel was tired...

91
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,300
so I went for a walk

92
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,700
Claude found a book in his room...

93
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,400
an anonymous gift

94
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
"Eureka" by Edgar Allen Poe

95
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,100
may I see you?

96
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,800
I'll be right there

97
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
I want to talk as we did in Paris

98
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,700
I don't know how to tell you this...

99
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
just say it

100
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
it seems I brought you here
for nothing

101
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
mother's angry with Muriel,
it spoils everything

102
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
I hadn't noticed

103
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,500
Muriel damaged her eyes working
at night for her professor...

104
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
on a book, I think

105
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,400
mother says
she should've asked her...

106
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
that she mustn't hide things

107
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,700
Muriel admits she's at fault...

108
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
but says
you have to take risks in life...

109
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,500
and shouldn't always have
to consult your mother

110
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
the entire household is upset

111
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
and also...

112
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,800
she didn't go on

113
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Claude wanted to take her hand

114
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,900
he imagined
her distant voice saying...

115
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,400
"and also... kiss me"

116
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,300
he tried to erase
this frivolous though

117
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,000
you haven't told me

118
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,700
how do you like Muriel?

119
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,200
I don't know her yet.
When I see her eyes...

120
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,100
when you do,
everything will change

121
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
'who muddies my water,
who makes so bold? '

122
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,300
'Growled the wolf, stern and cold'

123
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,700
'you'll be punished for this feat! '

124
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,000
'Sire' the lamb did bleat...

125
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,400
'I pray your majesty,
scalm your rage'

126
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,800
'consider that I assuage
my thirst... '

127
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
the 3 became inseparable

128
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,300
Claude liked
their lack of vanity...

129
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,100
they never spoke ill of anyone

130
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,800
Muriel now wore dark glasses

131
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,900
her expression was still hidden

132
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,900
she took up tennis again

133
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,800
she was quick and supple

134
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,300
walking home,
Anne went ahead, hips swinging

135
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,800
Mrs brown had made the girls read...

136
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,500
"Les miserables" in English

137
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,800
Anne could quote Verlaine.
Muriel, only the bible

138
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,300
Claude attacked Muriel
on this point. He persisted...

139
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,300
then grew uneasy

140
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
did I shock you?

141
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
On the contrary, I'm grateful

142
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,300
you talk a lot
but we need shaking up

143
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,200
you help me to think

144
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm slow...

145
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
we must go in

146
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,500
dear mother,
I begin to know Muriel

147
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,800
she's not yet
as Anne described her...

148
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
but she's convalescing

149
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,600
my adopted sisters call me
"the continent" which sounds wrong

150
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,700
I prefer their "bonjour la France!"

151
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,600
They played silly games...

152
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,500
Claude always lost

153
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,100
he told them

154
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
that suicide
wasn't a crime in France

155
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,600
"all France would be in jail,
since everyone has tried it"

156
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,500
"even you?"

157
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
"Yes, of course"

158
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,700
he would tell all,
after changing places

159
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,100
I'd rather not be between you

160
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,200
I like to be able to look at you

161
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I was 15 when I decided to die

162
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,800
I locked my bedroom door...

163
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,800
and put an alcohol burner
under my bed

164
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,800
I lit it and then lay down...

165
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,200
calmly

166
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,700
I took a razor...

167
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,900
and carefully slit my wrists

168
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,800
the blood spurted out...

169
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,600
I fainted...

170
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,900
and woke up in my mother's bed

171
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
my wrists were bandaged
and mother sat near me

172
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,400
the doctor was there, very stern

173
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,100
the bed didn't burn well...

174
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,400
and the cook saw smoke coming
from under the door

175
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
your mother?

176
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Never said a word

177
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
good for her

178
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,900
how tall was your building?

179
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Six floors, I think

180
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
nice funeral pyre

181
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,200
you were dying for a dream...

182
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,000
but you could've killed...

183
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,400
children on the floors above

184
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,900
I didn't think

185
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,800
now how do you like Muriel?

186
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,600
She's perfect in her way

187
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
is that all?

188
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,600
So my lightning-bolt didn't strike

189
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,200
I'll have to leave
you two alone more often

190
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
here she is...

191
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,300
they came back...

192
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,400
on foot

193
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,900
they stopped by a river
full of torrents

194
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,300
they decided the tumbling water
was like Anne...

195
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,800
the eddies like Claude,
the peaceful pools like Muriel

196
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,800
he felt at home with them

197
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
he wrote about them in his diary...

198
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
watching them was better

199
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,800
I could go on about them for pages

200
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,400
I'd rather just watch them

201
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,500
little by little...

202
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,500
Muriel starts to be,
as Anne predicted...

203
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
in "first place"

204
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,300
they laughed while Claude watched

205
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,900
Mrs brown was like a ball
being pushed to and fro

206
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
suddenly he was a pawn
in a strange game

207
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
squeezed between the girls...

208
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,500
he didn't dare breathe

209
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,400
he'd never even touched their hands

210
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,900
now their supple backs...

211
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,600
thrust against him

212
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,100
it was like an indiscretion

213
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,300
Mrs brown laughed...
he saw she had once been pretty

214
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,900
"... and they called this game... "

215
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,900
"the citron presse"

216
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,900
"they're superior
to the french girls I know"

217
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,100
"they've become my sisters"

218
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,200
"what are they like?"

219
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
"First... my sister Anne"

220
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,600
"I lend her books I like... "

221
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,000
"she doesn't like them.
We argue... "

222
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,100
"then she laughs and says
she's just an ordinary girl"

223
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,600
"Anne considers Muriel
far above her"

224
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,800
"Muriel's no prettier,
she's different"

225
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,700
"when we climb the cliffs... "

226
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,800
"she's like an Anglo-mountaineer... "

227
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,900
Anglo-mountaineer?

228
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,700
"Swinging her hips vigorously"

229
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,600
"it could seem provocative... "

230
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,700
"but she is so pure"

231
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,800
"Muriel... is purity"

232
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,200
he's in love with her

233
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
in love with whom?

234
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
With Mlle Muriel

235
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,300
in love with Muriel?

236
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,600
Ridiculous! He loves them both

237
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
go on!

238
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,100
Coming?

239
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,400
Not today

240
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,300
- I'd rather not.
- I insist you come!

241
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,400
I insist I stay!

242
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
Have a nice walk

243
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,400
your English won't improve

244
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
you must talk
to other English people

245
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,600
I can only talk to one at a time

246
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,100
once there are two...

247
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,800
they get together and ignore me

248
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,400
I find the English argumentative...

249
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,900
disdainful, insensitive...

250
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
and unimaginative

251
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,100
and you're blunt
and over-confident

252
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
you don't know life

253
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,000
and you do?

254
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,300
For instance love... physical love

255
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,000
the only love is true love

256
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,000
which is physical love

257
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,900
you talk too much

258
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,300
a continental gentleman
would notice...

259
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,500
that his islander audience
was tired

260
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,500
I'm not hungry

261
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,100
she led him along,
as Anne had done

262
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,500
the same situation, a month later

263
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,400
the sisters were so alike,
yet so unlike...

264
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,500
he marveled that they treated him
as a brother

265
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,700
Muriel stayed in her room
for the next 2 days

266
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,900
Claude didn't believe
she was really ill

267
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,500
had he offended her somehow?

268
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,300
He couldn't read,
or think of anything else

269
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,200
he thought of Muriel

270
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,200
I heard you.
You're not sick?

271
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm not sick, I just couldn't sleep

272
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,400
I was thinking of you

273
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
you mustn't think of me

274
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,700
why are you angry with me?
What have I done?

275
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,100
I'm not angry... I'm afraid

276
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
afraid?

277
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Whenever I say I'm afraid...

278
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
you always ask: "of what?"

279
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Maybe "afraid"
has another meaning in french

280
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,800
even when I thought
you were angry...

281
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
I couldn't criticize you...

282
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,700
you must criticize me!

283
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,500
Friends must criticize, not flatter

284
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,300
spoil me
and you'll spoil everything!

285
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,300
Goodnight, Claude

286
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
why do you touch me?

287
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Because you come from the earth...
I like that

288
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,100
we must go to sleep now

289
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,500
we have some questions about...

290
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
you say it, Anne

291
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,400
but I don't know what...

292
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,600
yes, you do, remember?

293
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Of course...

294
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,900
how mysterious!

295
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,100
We're curious about...
scarlet women

296
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
good lord!

297
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,700
Well, I'll do my best to answer you

298
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,300
it's a recognized profession
in France?

299
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
It's under police supervision

300
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,700
the girls are examined monthly

301
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,100
how horrible!

302
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,100
There are special houses...

303
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,000
you mean brothels?

304
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
You know that word?

305
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,700
We had 6 near our military camp

306
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,100
did you go?

307
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I visited the one
considered to be the best

308
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,200
officers, civil servants
and townsmen used it

309
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,100
the stairs were screened
to preserve privacy

310
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
good idea

311
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
inside, it was impeccable...

312
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
the girls modestly dressed

313
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,500
I said I had come to talk

314
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,000
an attractive woman said...

315
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,300
"fine, I'll call madame"

316
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,500
the woman in charge

317
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,400
a plump, respectable-looking
brunette

318
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,900
she had an anisette with me

319
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,900
I praised her well-run house

320
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,800
she thanked me

321
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,300
I got her going on her work

322
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,700
she felt part of the community...

323
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,200
as much as the mayor
or the colonel...

324
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,300
both of whom were customers

325
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,100
"we contribute to public health... "

326
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,000
"and family well-being"

327
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,800
"I don't allow disease or scandal"

328
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,700
a conscientious woman

329
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,300
she thought
she played a useful role?

330
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Absolutely

331
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
incredible!

332
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,100
But who are we to condemn her?

333
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,700
One day maybe you can take us

334
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
we want to see for ourselves

335
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,800
take you? Yes, maybe

336
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,100
why not, in fact?

337
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,100
Our education glosses over
certain essentials

338
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800
for example...

339
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,500
I didn't understand "virgin"
until I read germinal

340
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,800
do you agree?

341
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
To choose between 2 things,
you must know both

342
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,700
I can't choose vice or virtue...

343
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,900
knowing only virtue

344
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,400
Anne thanked him...

345
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,400
"you shake us out
of our complacency"

346
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,400
they bicycled back home

347
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,900
Claude liked the back
of Muriel's neck...

348
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
he could stare at it unseen

349
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,900
mother wants you

350
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,800
after dinner?

351
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
You'd better go now

352
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,000
I have two things to say...

353
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,300
the first is this...

354
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,500
I admire your mother

355
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,900
she's my friend,
she has great character

356
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,200
having lost her husband
even younger than I did...

357
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
she never remarried
despite many chances

358
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
the second thing is...

359
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,000
I've heard about a conversation
here late at night

360
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,000
luckily it's thought Anne was there

361
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,700
Anne tells me she was not there

362
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,700
I trust my girls
and I know you're a gentleman

363
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,100
they have advanced ideas
that I don't share

364
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
the ideas have grown
since you came

365
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,500
they've explained them

366
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,600
though I've tried, I can't approve

367
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,700
these ideas lead
to a freedom of behavior...

368
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,200
which has aroused comment

369
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,200
from a purely practical
standpoint...

370
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,500
a girl must do nothing
to arouse comment

371
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,900
her reputation will suffer

372
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,600
I asked Anne
how she stood with you

373
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,500
had there been any hint...

374
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,300
of an inclination...

375
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
or intentions? She said no...

376
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,100
and I believe her

377
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,100
I asked her about you and Muriel.
She gave the same answer

378
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,200
she finally said...

379
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,800
"I think Muriel and Claude... "

380
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,800
"have some feeling
for each other... "

381
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
"but they don't know it yet"

382
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,600
in my day we knew those things

383
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,400
therefore I must ask you...

384
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,900
no... come with me

385
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,200
I must ask you to stay
with our friend, Mr flint

386
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
that's his house there

387
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
I also want to say this...

388
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,100
if Anne's prediction comes true...

389
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,000
if one day
a stronger feeling grows...

390
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,700
between you and Muriel...

391
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,600
and you both
deign to recognize it...

392
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,800
I'll not be against it,
personally...

393
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,200
though I have my doubts
about international marriages

394
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,600
in Claude's confusion,
one thought stood out...

395
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,600
Muriel might yet
fall in love with him

396
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,800
Eros took possession
of Claude's heart

397
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,200
he was too busy dreaming of her...

398
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,100
to mope over not seeing her

399
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,600
he now had one goal: Muriel

400
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,500
in his room at Mr flint's...

401
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,300
Claude couldn't sleep

402
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
he thought:
Anne has pledged me to Muriel

403
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,900
there must be a reason.
This love isn't hopeless, after all

404
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,000
I loved Muriel but I wavered...

405
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
thinking she couldn't love me

406
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,100
what Mrs brown had done...

407
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,800
was to open a door for Claude.
He must rush in...

408
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,900
risking all for Muriel

409
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Muriel, your stern face...

410
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,300
so relaxed when you smile,
is engraved in my heart

411
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,600
each day is a milestone

412
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
I see you in our home
with our child

413
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,700
this image absorbs me

414
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,500
I must earn a living

415
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,000
that takes precedence over
the books I want to write

416
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,500
Mr flint's company needs a man...

417
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,100
to handle french correspondance

418
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
I'll apply.
I'll adopt your country...

419
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,500
I love you, I want you for my wife

420
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
a letter for you

421
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,900
Muriel's answer?

422
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm afraid to open it

423
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,100
you know what it says?

424
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,900
Claude, you don't know me.
I'm a simple girl

425
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,300
my family is enough for me

426
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,400
don't be hurt. Tell yourself...

427
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,800
"she doesn't love me, nor I her"

428
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
"we're brother and sister"

429
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,900
I'll never be your wife

430
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,100
poor Claude

431
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,000
it's my fault

432
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,700
I started all this

433
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,800
you're not to blame.
Anyway, I must leave

434
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,300
I don't believe
everything Muriel says

435
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't want to give you
false hope...

436
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,900
but maybe she doesn't know
her own mind

437
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,300
I admire her letter

438
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,100
I aimed too high

439
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,400
I must lower my sights...

440
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
and destroy this love

441
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,600
you're wrong

442
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,200
if I were you,
I wouldn't destroy my love

443
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Muriel can change... yes

444
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,500
come see us tomorrow

445
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,900
no, I won't come

446
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,900
you'll come

447
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,200
Claude, I adore you...

448
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Claude, I want
to be honest with you

449
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
when you asked me to marry you...

450
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,300
I found it incredible

451
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,900
I replied: "no, never"

452
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,500
is that "never"
engraved in your heart?

453
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,200
I must keep you informed, right?

454
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
I still say "no"...

455
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,000
but I withdraw the "never"

456
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm like a river
that rises and falls

457
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,600
that's why I can't answer you now

458
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,500
then there's hope?

459
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,400
A beginning of hope

460
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,300
good...

461
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,700
may I tell my mother?

462
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,400
Yes, if you feel the need

463
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,100
no, Claude, don't say any more...

464
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,200
don't add anything

465
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,000
mother, I love Muriel

466
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,900
I waited to tell you
until there was hope

467
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,200
I think you'll be pleased.
Muriel resembles you

468
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,100
Mrs brown distrusts
such marriages...

469
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,700
but leaves Muriel free

470
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,500
we await your arrival

471
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,800
it all happened so suddenly

472
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,200
I'm not afraid of losing you,
I'm worried about you

473
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,000
how will you live...

474
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
and on what?

475
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,000
Like you,
Muriel wants me to write

476
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,900
but I prefer
a steady job, perhaps...

477
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,200
with Mr flint

478
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,100
you're not well yet

479
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm sure Muriel
has many good qualities

480
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:52,100
but for 3 years she has had to care
for her eyes... you told me so!

481
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,900
You were pushed into it

482
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,000
you wouldn't have thought of it

483
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,200
when your father died,
I raised you

484
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,900
my monument... I raised you
stone by stone

485
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,000
Claude's mother was firm.
She'd never felt physical love

486
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,500
to Claude,
this explained her hostility

487
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
hoping to reconcile
the irreconcilable

488
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,300
Mr flint was asked to arbitrate

489
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,100
we're here to discuss a marriage

490
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,800
I have heard...

491
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,800
the pros and cons

492
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,500
the girl's mother...

493
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,000
asks that the matter...

494
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,600
be decided quickly...

495
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,400
one way or another

496
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,800
the young man's mother...

497
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,900
thinks their state of health...

498
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,900
makes the marriage impossible

499
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,300
after reflection...

500
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I propose the following

501
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,300
out of respect for their mothers...

502
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,800
Muriel and Claude will separate
for a year

503
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,200
during that year
they'll take care of themselves...

504
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,200
conscientiously

505
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,500
they'll neither see
nor write each other

506
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,500
what we ask of them is a sacrifice

507
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,600
but if, after a year...

508
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,100
they wish to marry...

509
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,200
or resume their friendship...

510
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,300
neither mother...

511
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,000
not Claude's...

512
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,100
nor Muriel's,
will stand in their way

513
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,200
Claude's mother knew
a lot could happen in a year

514
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,400
the youngsters found it inhuman...

515
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,400
they longed to be together

516
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,400
it won't be difficult,
if we're brave

517
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,600
Claude, look at me

518
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,300
I have an idea

519
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,400
let's both keep diaries
to send each other

520
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,000
what if one of us had died...

521
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,600
god be with us!

522
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,300
I just took communion for Claude

523
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,500
I don't know what it means,
but it was for him

524
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,800
if I wanted to get pregnant,
I wouldn't know how

525
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,100
if Claude still loves me
in a year...

526
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,700
I'll say to him...

527
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,700
"I'm yours,
do with me as you will"

528
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,800
if he were a pirate
and abducted me...

529
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,800
I'd go willingly

530
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,000
Claude thought: My last summer
with mother before I marry Muriel

531
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,800
he was overly attentive
playing the role of "good son"

532
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,600
like David Copperfield,
he'd never known his father

533
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
his mother told him...

534
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,200
of their courtship

535
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
his mother died

536
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,100
the day after the funeral...

537
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,000
he asked my mother for my hand

538
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,700
then he came to me

539
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,500
I said: "wasn't it arranged?"

540
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,600
He said: "that's true"

541
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,800
he courted me, not with flowers
but with beautiful books

542
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,800
we married very quickly

543
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,300
he was 31 and I was 23

544
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,600
we lived
near the Luxembourg gardens

545
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,000
then I was expecting you

546
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,900
Sundays, tired by my pregnancy...

547
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
I wanted to sit in the park

548
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,600
Pierre would say:

549
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,300
"Let's visit the Louvre
so our son will love art"

550
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
we'd hire a carriage and go

551
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,100
a collector had asked Claude...

552
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,300
to select some paintings for him

553
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,200
a modern art exhibit
was opening in London

554
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,200
he resolved to go
without his mother

555
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,700
she was worried about him
seeing Muriel

556
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,700
you won't try to see her?

557
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,700
No, mother, a promise is a promise

558
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,900
Muriel! Come back...

559
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,200
Claude, I was told
you were in England

560
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,900
were you in our town?

561
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,900
On our street?

562
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm afraid to meet you...

563
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,200
yet my eyes seek you

564
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,800
my friend Claude, do I love you?

565
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,500
Not at all!

566
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,100
If we met, I would say...

567
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,200
"you're no husband for me"

568
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
you've never courted me

569
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,400
you forced me
to fall in love with you

570
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,100
that's all... goodbye, Claude

571
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,100
I don't love you

572
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,900
on his return, his mother said...

573
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,400
he should manage their property

574
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,400
he took charge of the 3 buildings
inherited from his father

575
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,600
a nice view...

576
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,600
yes. It's a bit dirty...
but it could be fixed up

577
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,700
it'd be a charming place

578
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,500
perfect for a bachelor

579
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,200
in one of the buildings
a garret flat was free

580
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,100
he decided to move in

581
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,500
an article about women painters
brought Claude a thank-you note

582
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:37,000
he visited the sender.
Her studio was unusual

583
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,700
you know we almost met before...

584
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
at Massoulier's on Friday

585
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
yes, I was there

586
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,100
I came at midnight.
You'd just left...

587
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,700
like Cinderella

588
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,200
doesn't that bowl you over?

589
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,900
Pretty, aren't they?

590
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,300
Want to see all of me?

591
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,700
It's very...

592
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,000
no compliments are necessary

593
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,000
come, I've work to do

594
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,000
we could meet somewhere
quieter sometime

595
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,600
fine... gladly

596
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,500
why not tonight?

597
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,500
Tonight? Yes

598
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,700
why put off today's follies
until tomorrow

599
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,600
see you tonight

600
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,900
as you were before, girls

601
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,900
don't forget to raise your head

602
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,800
that way, your hat...

603
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,100
perfect... you're lovely

604
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,700
this is Monique de Monferrand

605
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,900
my mother...

606
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,000
see you on Friday?

607
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,200
No! Georges will be back...
I'll write

608
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,900
let's hear your criticism

609
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,400
no criticism... on the contrary

610
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,800
I'm surprised
the place can look so good

611
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,500
lovely...

612
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,100
quite lovely

613
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,200
you're writing to Muriel?

614
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,300
Yes and no...

615
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
that is...

616
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
here, read it

617
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,400
you win...
it only took 6 months

618
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,000
go on, read it

619
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,100
"dear Muriel...
I must live my life... alone

620
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,900
"I won't get to England
for a while

621
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,500
"I'll travel in Europe,
see painters...

622
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,400
"write about them,
do translations

623
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,000
"I must live without wife or child

624
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,800
"this should relieve you

625
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,700
"I have women friends...

626
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,900
"but I shall not marry

627
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,600
"I can live without my sisters but
they won't be forgotten or replaced

628
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,000
"we'll write each other
sometimes...

629
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,900
"but for your sake,
we must say farewell

630
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,500
"your brother, Claude"

631
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,200
but don't ask me
to be your sister!

632
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,300
"Women friends...!"

633
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,900
Dear Claude...

634
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,400
your answer is no, mine is yes

635
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,600
we change places,
as in musical chairs

636
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,100
you no longer want me to love you

637
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,700
if you came, you'd see
how much I'd love you

638
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,000
so would Anne and mother

639
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,700
they would try to influence you

640
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,100
if you came,
my love would reawaken yours

641
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,600
you mustn't come

642
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,800
had you opened your arms...

643
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,500
as one day you will to another...

644
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,200
I would have run to you, trembling

645
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,900
it is not to be

646
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,400
never think that you have hurt me

647
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,800
it is enough that once you loved me

648
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,300
I collapsed on my bed,
crying and calling you

649
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,700
she didn't send it
nor the others she wrote later

650
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,200
did he suffer
when he destroyed our love?

651
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,300
Do men often lead women
to want them...

652
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,600
then say "no, thank you"?

653
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,500
"I am your sister"

654
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,400
I still have prayer

655
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,700
Claude, I pray for your purity

656
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,700
your ideas about women
will change

657
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,000
if you love another,
it will be all right

658
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
love doesn't complicate life...

659
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,000
but the uncertainty of love

660
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,700
I am without hope

661
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,200
I only know I must hold on...
it's vital

662
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,900
I must hold on!

663
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,100
Life is made up of pieces
that don't fit

664
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,500
I want all of Claude, or nothing

665
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,100
if it's no... let it be like death

666
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,200
it's Muriel's answer

667
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,800
read it... I want your opinion

668
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,300
"dear Claude,
I'm glad you wrote me...

669
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,000
"thus ending a misunderstanding
and a false situation

670
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,500
"it's best to renounce
the marriage immediately

671
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,800
"Anne and I will always be
your friends

672
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,500
"the garden is superb

673
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,700
"we're going to London
to see the new plays

674
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,900
"regards from my mother.
Your sister, Muriel"

675
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,800
an excellent letter

676
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,300
I knew she was a sensible girl

677
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
are you reassured? Happy?

678
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,300
You're not happy?

679
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,600
Yes...

680
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,900
you took this on deposit?

681
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,300
The two of them

682
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,500
but this one's going back
to the gallery

683
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,900
time passed...

684
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,300
Claude had not become
an author...

685
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,400
but he wrote articles about art

686
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,900
his mother condoned his affairs...

687
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,100
many women were less
threatening than one

688
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,900
he forgot his "sisters"

689
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,100
in Wales, Muriel slowly recovered

690
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,400
at times she went to bed saying...

691
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,000
"today I didn't think about Claude"

692
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,600
did you know Anne brown
was in Paris?

693
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,900
Her mother wrote me

694
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,200
you didn't tell me

695
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,700
it was part of our agreement

696
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,500
but it's Anne... not Muriel

697
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,300
it's the same thing

698
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,000
I'll write her a note

699
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,700
instead of writing,
go talk to her

700
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,700
what about you?

701
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,400
I'll go exchange these books

702
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,300
I'll see you tomorrow

703
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,100
you're not angry?

704
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,900
No, I'm not

705
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,400
till tomorrow

706
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,700
been back in Paris long?

707
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,000
Since January

708
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,100
that's when I arrived!

709
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,300
How about me? Have I changed?

710
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,900
You seem serious,
but you look fine

711
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,300
don't you want news of someone?

712
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,400
Yes... how is she?

713
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,900
She's been sick... her eyes

714
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,300
but she's suffered more
from other things

715
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,400
I understand

716
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,800
and now?

717
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,700
She's better.
She works with children

718
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,100
she teaches Sunday school

719
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,400
actually, I can't tell you
much about her

720
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,400
she no longer confides in me
and I'm sorry

721
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,400
two words are never spoken
in our house...

722
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,100
the words "Claude" and "Paris"

723
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,900
Anne was becoming a sculptress

724
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,700
she had a studio in Paris

725
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,300
she now felt sure
Muriel and Claude...

726
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,500
would never get together.
Yet they'd come so close

727
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,600
no longer in Muriel's shadow...

728
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,100
Anne was the girl
that he'd first met

729
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,300
she was there for herself
and he liked that

730
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,200
they often went to look...

731
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,100
at Rodin's "Balzac",
done on commission...

732
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,600
then indignantly refused

733
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,600
Claude often went to Anne's studio

734
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,700
he encouraged her...

735
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,400
gave her confidence in her work

736
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Claude found Anne especially
pretty today...

737
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,500
he sensed her heart beating like his

738
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,400
Muriel was no longer a barrier

739
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,800
he had a mad idea:
Caress her breast

740
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,500
why not try?

741
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Would she be shocked,
or slap him?

742
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,300
No, Claude, wait...

743
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,900
listen to me

744
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,000
she moved away from him
to explain...

745
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,900
someone had always
overshadowed her...

746
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,800
dazzled her, silenced her.
It was Muriel

747
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,200
Anne had introduced Claude
to Muriel...

748
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,200
for pleasure,
to see them match wits

749
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,000
picturing them married,
she'd stepped aside

750
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,300
virtuous? No... realistic

751
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,300
were you jealous of her?

752
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Sometimes... but not for long

753
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,900
when you played tennis together...

754
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,700
you were a real couple

755
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,300
and we failed

756
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,100
no man had touched Anne...
she'd be his

757
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,500
he'd be the first...
but not here, not in Paris

758
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,800
they'd go away

759
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,100
Claude borrowed an island cabin
on a Swiss lake

760
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,900
they'd go there for a week.
They'd try... draw closer

761
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,500
they were more resolute
than in love

762
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,800
tomorrow we must buy matches

763
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,600
a hot meal would be nice

764
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,500
wait... just for a moment

765
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,100
the 1st night, Anne pulled away

766
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,600
she put up a blanket as a curtain

767
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,400
Claude was to undress
on his own side

768
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,500
the island is pretty, isn't it?

769
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,400
I'm sure the old lady would sell it

770
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,700
I wonder how much she'd want

771
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,000
are you in bed?

772
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,900
May I come?

773
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,500
You're not answering

774
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,500
are you asleep?

775
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,300
It's very nice

776
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,000
tell me, Anne...

777
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,200
haven't you ever wanted a man?

778
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,700
There was one last summer...
much too handsome

779
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,200
his face was too symmetrical

780
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,400
I dreamed about him

781
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,000
I dreamed he kissed me there

782
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,000
I knew it, I was sure!

783
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,100
You have great curiosity
about men...

784
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,400
almost a divine curiosity

785
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,800
it will lead you
to have many lovers

786
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,900
think so?

787
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,100
I don't know

788
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,500
I only care about my work

789
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,500
I'll make statues, not babies

790
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,800
the 2nd night: More kisses

791
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
is the word "copain"
vulgar in french?

792
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,000
No, just colloquial

793
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,400
it means "friend"...
but warmer and more intimate

794
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,900
I'm your "copain" then?

795
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,400
Sometimes,
but we're more than that

796
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:57,600
"copains" don't kiss on the lips
with hearts racing

797
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,200
I'm tired of being a virgin,
but I'm afraid

798
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,500
afraid?

799
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,800
If you're afraid, we'll wait

800
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,900
you're not angry?

801
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,700
I'm glad we have time

802
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,700
nothing to say?

803
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,200
I'm listening to you...

804
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,000
watching you

805
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,500
I'm glad you're here

806
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,200
the 3rd night,
Anne seemed very busy

807
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,500
what are you doing?

808
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,300
I've decided

809
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,300
no curtain tonight

810
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,100
no blouse

811
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,000
no skirt

812
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,800
Anne... what is that?

813
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,800
Her underclothes were impossible.
Fashioned with a knife...

814
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
red flannel, military-looking

815
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,800
she removed them simply
and came to him nude

816
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,500
now, Claude

817
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,800
I'm ready now

818
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,700
are you sure?

819
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,200
I'm sure

820
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,100
not afraid any more?

821
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,200
It had to be...

822
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,100
I'm happy

823
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,000
because you wanted to...

824
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,400
but it's not yet... us

825
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,800
it was as if you were alone

826
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,600
the week ended.
Claude wanted to stay on

827
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,800
Anne refused saying:
"Now I see life differently"

828
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,400
"I can learn the rest alone
but I've only you, for love"

829
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,100
she was going home to England,
Claude to Paris, alone

830
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,700
Anne gave him one last nod
of farewell

831
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,900
they were free and it was good

832
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,800
monsieur Claude, your mail

833
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,100
thank you...

834
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,700
are you staying here now?

835
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,200
For a while

836
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,500
dear Claude,
I came home yesterday

837
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,300
this is some wallpaper
from our room

838
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,400
mother and Muriel are in bed

839
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,900
I cried

840
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,200
you're more real than my sculpture

841
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,500
I felt you kissing me yesterday...

842
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,400
Wednesday afternoon at 4

843
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,400
were you thinking of me then?

844
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,700
When I look in the mirror
I wish I'd given you more

845
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,500
Muriel knows I see you, that's all

846
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,900
I know you have other women
but I'm not jealous

847
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,100
3 months later,
Anne was back in Paris

848
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,300
on the stairs
he already wanted her profoundly

849
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,500
she'd changed... the "half-tomboy"
aspect was gone

850
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,300
she was a woman...

851
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,000
have you had breakfast?

852
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,600
No, I thought
I'd have it with you

853
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,800
but I've nothing here

854
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,400
their eyes met...
hers were now daring

855
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,900
their love-making was new
for them both

856
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,000
Anne now knew
how to use her body

857
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,000
how strange!

858
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,900
What?

859
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,100
To love someone so much

860
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,200
he realized it was 3 years ago
that he had first desired her

861
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,800
you're my breakfast

862
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,000
Claude... I'm too happy

863
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,200
I should have other lovers

864
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,500
I'll let you do the same

865
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,300
love me as much as you can

866
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,200
happiness can't be told,
but it wears down... unnoticed

867
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,300
in public,
Claude rediscovered Anne

868
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,900
she dressed better... smarter

869
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:00,300
they'd just made love,
yet she looked so virginal

870
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,500
Anne accepted Claude's ideas
on free love

871
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,600
he could have other affairs,
but she refused...

872
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,800
rejecting all offers

873
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,300
Diurka, a brawny Slav, spotted Anne.
He published...

874
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,800
art books.
Handsome in a way...

875
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,700
he had youthful eyes.
He liked her, he wanted her

876
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,200
Claude thought...

877
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,300
"if she likes him... she's free"

878
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,600
Claude saw what Anne meant
when she'd said...

879
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,100
"I'm always a success just after... "

880
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,100
Claude let the day go by,
the night...

881
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,700
next morning...

882
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,200
Claude, I must talk to you

883
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,600
come with me...

884
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,300
I'm listening

885
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,700
you already know

886
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,800
Diurka

887
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,500
he was here... when I knocked

888
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,500
do you love him?

889
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,000
I don't know yet

890
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,100
does he love you?

891
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,200
He came to see me.
He looked at my work...

892
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,200
made perceptive comments

893
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,300
he didn't leave

894
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,600
since this morning, we...

895
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,400
does it bother you?

896
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,400
Are you hurt?

897
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,200
I thought you...

898
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,400
true, but it's still a shock

899
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,000
anyway, I approve...
you're right

900
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:02,900
Diurka says
he's been alone for a year

901
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,300
I didn't want to,
I don't love him yet

902
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,500
then he wanted to...

903
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,100
Diurka's a fine person...

904
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,900
you think so, too?

905
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,800
He wants to take me to Persia
with him

906
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,600
I think I'll say No

907
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,900
Persia is magnificent

908
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,400
Anne, only your desires matter

909
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,500
you just met Diurka, go with him

910
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,400
I think you two need time alone

911
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,500
I shouldn't see you...

912
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,000
yes, you should!

913
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,500
So Anne had two regular lovers

914
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,400
they both knew,
Anne didn't hide it

915
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,200
the lovers suffered...
Anne thrived

916
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,100
before Persia,
their farewell lasted all night

917
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,900
dear Claude, you'd love Persia...

918
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,400
you were my life

919
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,500
I only missed you in one way,
I won't say which

920
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,700
your letter said...

921
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:25,100
"don't be afraid to love. "
I obeyed

922
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,600
my uncle used to tell my aunt not to
fear being seasick... she often was

923
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,200
I'm home with Muriel

924
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,000
I'll be in Paris in 3 months...
Anne

925
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,300
Claude recognized Muriel's writing

926
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,200
he was afraid
she'd returned his letter

927
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,100
instead it was part of her diary...

928
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,600
probably
the most intimate confession...

929
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,600
that he would ever read

930
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,700
dear Claude,
we'll never meet again...

931
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,500
and surely that's best

932
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,600
but you mustn't believe I'm pure

933
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,400
I've something terrible to tell you

934
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,300
read my confession...
you'll see that we're even

935
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,600
I've learned from a leaflet...

936
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,700
that since childhood
I've had "nasty habits"

937
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,200
I've weakened my body and brain.
I've abused myself

938
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:52,400
now I know that I'm no longer
a pure woman

939
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,900
it's my duty to confess this to you

940
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,100
no shame will stop me,
I am what I am

941
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,900
if you thought of me as unsullied,
you were wrong

942
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,700
I was eight. A girl, Clarisse...

943
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,900
was first in class. I was second

944
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:11,300
she looked like a mischievous angel.
I was told to be like her

945
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,900
her family spent a week with us

946
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,800
Clarisse slept with me...

947
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
in place of Anne, who was away

948
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,000
in bed, she stripped...

949
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,500
and said I should, too

950
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,500
then she embraced me

951
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,100
I was devoted to her

952
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,500
two little girls
caressed all night...

953
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,500
one knowing, one docile

954
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,500
she taught me to touch
certain parts of my body...

955
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,200
one especially.
She convinced me...

956
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,900
not to talk about our secret

957
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:47,300
after she left
I sometimes did it alone

958
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,500
I didn't understand that part of me

959
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,000
I only knew it was private
and mustn't be seen

960
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
it wasn't to be mentioned

961
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,000
the habit would leave me alone...
then come back

962
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,400
I'd give into it... angry...
unable to stop

963
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,300
one sultry Sunday
when I was 17...

964
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:10,100
I was lying in a field
gazing at the sky

965
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,300
I gave in again...

966
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,300
driven by an unknown force

967
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,400
sometimes I thought of it...

968
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,900
as a way to get to sleep
and to warm my cold feet

969
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,500
but I hated being a slave to it

970
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,400
I fought it, twisting my hands...

971
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,900
face buried, pleading with god

972
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,200
if I couldn't go to sleep...

973
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,100
or think of something else...

974
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,300
I gave in,
then forbade myself to pray

975
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,800
here's a copy of a letter
from America

976
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,000
it has helped me

977
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,800
"my dear young friend...

978
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,300
"your appeal aroused my sympathy

979
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:48,000
"understand your plight
and feel no repugnance

980
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,700
"I admire your frankness

981
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,800
"if you give way, tell yourself...

982
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,700
"that it wasn't you

983
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,400
"you despise this act

984
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,700
"then jump out of bed...

985
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
"and take a cold bath

986
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,800
"don't waste time in self-reproach

987
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,800
"lead an active life, help others

988
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,100
"you learned this habit
despite yourself. It will cease

989
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,300
"best wishes... "

990
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,000
Muriel's confession aroused
more curiosity than emotion

991
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,800
Claude thought...

992
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,500
it was marketable.
He wanted to publish it...

993
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,500
anonymously, in a limited edition

994
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,700
Muriel refused,
not saying how he'd hurt her

995
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,500
"I've abused myself

996
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,300
"now I know that...

997
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,400
"I'm no longer a pure woman

998
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,800
"it's my duty
to confess this to you

999
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,300
"no shame will stop me

1000
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,300
"I am what I am

1001
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,800
"if you thought of me
as unsullied...

1002
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,300
"now you know you were wrong"

1003
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,200
it's all that's left?

1004
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,500
Your properties cost more
than they bring in

1005
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:27,000
repairs
on the rue de Bagnolet place...

1006
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:31,000
wipe out the income
from the others

1007
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,300
what do you advise?

1008
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,800
Sell that one...

1009
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,100
and keep the two others

1010
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,900
I may have a buyer

1011
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,300
I must ask my mother

1012
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,000
go ahead... but quickly

1013
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,300
buyers don't grow on trees

1014
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,200
I'll wait...

1015
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,200
I'm sorry to tire you, mother

1016
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,900
it's dark in here...
light the gas

1017
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,300
the lawyer says
to sell rue de Bagnolet

1018
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,800
what do you think?

1019
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Whatever you do will be right

1020
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:14,000
Claude was alone. He had lost
the most demanding of all his women

1021
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:16,700
he was free to live his own life

1022
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,800
how would he use his freedom?

1023
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,700
Anne came back...

1024
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,100
more mature... prettier.

1025
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,500
Their love-making was restrained

1026
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:27,100
don't look at me

1027
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,500
what's this new modesty?

1028
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:31,800
I've seen you naked so often

1029
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,300
I'll turn around...

1030
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,400
but remember Eurydice!

1031
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,100
If our eyes meet, you'll die

1032
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,200
what did you say?

1033
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,600
Eurydice, the wife of Orpheus

1034
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,900
Anne was meant
to love only one man

1035
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,900
but if that man wasn't Claude...

1036
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,200
she'd go against her instinct

1037
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,700
I haven't been honest

1038
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,400
there's something
I haven't told you

1039
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,900
I didn't come to Paris alone

1040
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,200
Diurka?

1041
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,900
No, Diurka was Persia

1042
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,800
that's finished

1043
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,900
I brought Muriel with me

1044
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,900
she's in Paris.
Do you want to see her?

1045
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,600
I don't know...

1046
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,700
I want to see her if she wants it

1047
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,600
she wants it

1048
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,700
she's afraid
she means nothing to you

1049
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,300
she wants to see you
before leaving

1050
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,300
does she know about us?

1051
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,700
No, nothing at all

1052
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,800
but she must be told

1053
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,800
you're right... but not yet

1054
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,800
no, not yet...

1055
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,700
but it must be done

1056
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,800
she'll be at my studio tonight...

1057
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,500
4 years? Only yesterday!

1058
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:54,100
Muriel held her hand out stiffly
as she had the first time they met

1059
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,600
she could only remove her glasses...

1060
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,100
once the curtains cut off the light

1061
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,600
I've heard nothing from you in ages

1062
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,700
nothing that counts

1063
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:40,400
you didn't write, either

1064
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,800
I couldn't

1065
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,300
after you left, I lost
the normal use of my eyes

1066
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,400
Anne was away

1067
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,200
my left eye gave out first
and I nearly lost them both

1068
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,500
I spent 3 months in total darkness

1069
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,900
at that time I thanked god

1070
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,600
for not giving you a blind wife

1071
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,000
and now?

1072
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,100
I'm getting better

1073
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,100
I came here...

1074
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,700
I was afraid, but I wanted to

1075
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,500
Muriel's virtue frightened Claude

1076
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,500
he thought of her
as unapproachable

1077
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,100
he couldn't touch her
as he had Anne

1078
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,300
he felt insincere,
yet he was deeply moved

1079
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,600
the surprise came from Muriel

1080
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,000
I loved you so much

1081
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,200
I lived for you, Muriel

1082
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,400
I knew joy and pain...

1083
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,500
you're leaving?

1084
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,700
You won't stay with me?

1085
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,800
I can't...

1086
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,300
I wanted to see you again, but...

1087
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,900
I didn't expect to be so... affected

1088
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,000
I don't know what I think...
or want

1089
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,000
- I'll see you again.
- Are you sure?

1090
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,300
I must leave now...

1091
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,100
I must leave, Muriel!

1092
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,700
I found you at last

1093
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,400
here's a letter from Muriel

1094
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,100
I know she's still in love with you

1095
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,200
she says she loves me...

1096
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,100
she wants to go away with me

1097
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,000
you must accept
I know you love her, too

1098
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,100
yes, I love her...

1099
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,500
as much as I did before

1100
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,000
you must talk to her first

1101
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,200
you must tell her everything

1102
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,100
yes

1103
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,600
again Muriel had revealed...

1104
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,000
the violence
of her suppressed love

1105
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,900
Anne took her home
like an invalid

1106
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,800
Muriel wrote Claude
a farewell letter

1107
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:42,000
Anne told me everything,
she wasn't afraid to hurt me

1108
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,800
I was horrified... now I'm calm

1109
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,800
I know Anne loves you
and always will

1110
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,400
she loved you first...

1111
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,800
but silently renounced you
for my sake

1112
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,900
my selfishness made me blind

1113
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,400
she brought you to me...
almost had us engaged

1114
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,100
if a woman like Anne or me
gives herself, she's married

1115
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:05,700
do you want two wives
who are sisters?

1116
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:09,500
Anne and I love the same man.
It's tragic but not unusual

1117
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,200
I'll probably
always think about you

1118
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:15,100
but part of me
has withdrawn from you

1119
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,900
I leave for England in an hour

1120
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:20,400
forgive me for our kiss

1121
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,200
for the first time,
Claude suffered...

1122
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,100
as he had made
so many others suffer

1123
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:29,900
he was sunk in despair

1124
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,400
locked in darkness for days...

1125
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,700
he questioned his very identity

1126
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,700
waiting for sleep, he'd repeat...

1127
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,900
"I am nothing...
I understand nothing"

1128
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,800
slowly he healed himself...

1129
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,300
by writing a book.
"Jerome and Julien"...

1130
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,300
was about a woman
who loved two men

1131
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:54,600
it was his story, transposed
his love for the two sisters

1132
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:22,400
by chance,
Diurka published the book

1133
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:26,300
Claude was cool to him, at first.
Then he got to know and like him

1134
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,300
how do you feel about it?

1135
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,600
Mostly relieved

1136
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:34,000
writing it, I was unhappy

1137
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,400
I was miserable, because...

1138
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,900
it stirred up memories.
Now I feel better...

1139
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,200
as if the characters
had suffered for me

1140
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,600
I understand

1141
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,200
I liked your book very much

1142
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,200
it stirred up memories for me, too

1143
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,800
now I can tell you...
I didn't like you

1144
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,000
you got on my nerves, too

1145
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,600
Anne had only praise for you

1146
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,500
that didn't help any!

1147
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,800
Have you seen her?

1148
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,900
I wanted to...

1149
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:15,400
I heard she was engaged
to a mountain-climber

1150
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,000
she must be married now

1151
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,700
no... she broke her engagement

1152
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,500
why?

1153
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:28,000
I only know it's off,
I don't know why

1154
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,100
still think about her?

1155
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,800
Love stories
should be complete...

1156
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,300
with a beginning,
middle and end

1157
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,200
so our affair with Anne
is probably over

1158
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,900
still, I wonder
why she didn't marry him

1159
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,400
I know a good way to find out

1160
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,300
go and ask her

1161
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:07,700
filled with hope,
Diurka went to Wales

1162
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:10,100
after Persia, he'd let Anne go

1163
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,100
he'd been unable to show his love

1164
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:15,500
now he'd convince her
they could start again

1165
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,500
he'd persuade her
to come away with him

1166
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,000
he'd ask Mrs brown
for Anne's hand

1167
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,500
you remember me?

1168
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,800
I came to see Anne

1169
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,500
then you accept?

1170
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,300
I have your word?

1171
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:17,400
May I get Muriel?

1172
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,900
I spoke to her.
She accepts now

1173
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,500
thank you!

1174
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:06,800
That was why
she broke her engagement

1175
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
she knew she had tuberculosis

1176
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,400
she was superb...
she never told her fiance

1177
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,700
she let him think
she'd changed her mind...

1178
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,800
that she was capricious

1179
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,300
I arrived on a Sunday

1180
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,800
Muriel was teaching in the garden

1181
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,200
she explained everything

1182
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,700
I saw Anne right away...

1183
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,500
I persuaded her to see a doctor

1184
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,700
she died that afternoon,
before he arrived

1185
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,000
but why wouldn't she see a doctor?

1186
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,000
She thought it wasn't serious?

1187
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,300
I don't think so...
she knew she was dying

1188
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:51,500
maybe it was pride, or heroism

1189
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,400
before she died, she said
a beautiful but terrible thing...

1190
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,100
"my mouth is full of earth"

1191
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,100
how did Muriel take it?

1192
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,100
Muriel is like those old women

1193
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,800
who can't cry
over death any more

1194
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:54,600
I've had news of Muriel...

1195
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,600
from whom?

1196
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:00,800
I've had news

1197
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:04,300
she may go to Brussels
to teach English

1198
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,700
she lands at Calais in 2 days

1199
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,600
Calais?

1200
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,200
Muriel, this is my room

1201
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:10,200
shall we meet downstairs
in half an hour?

1202
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,700
Fine

1203
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,800
this way, madame...

1204
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:05,300
Claude finally held Muriel,
after 7 years!

1205
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:09,100
He made his intentions clear,
she could have run away

1206
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,800
she didn't run away, she was ready

1207
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:15,300
she was 30 years old...
she looked 20

1208
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,400
she was new and fresh,
like snow in his hands

1209
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:29,800
he persisted,
expecting her to resist

1210
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
she did not resist.
She fought for the same goal

1211
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,000
he forced her mouth open...

1212
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:53,700
she wanted it, despite her fear

1213
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,400
an unknown magnet
thrust them together

1214
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,400
the ribbon burst...
less easily than Anne's

1215
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,300
there was no tenderness

1216
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,500
Claude's aim was
to arm Muriel against him

1217
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:27,200
it was done

1218
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,700
red stained her gold

1219
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,300
what are you doing?

1220
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,900
I'm leaving

1221
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,100
why?

1222
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,100
Come here...

1223
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,500
dearest Claude...

1224
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:36,200
I came to see you
to bury this thing

1225
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,200
I'm glad you were the first...

1226
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,500
because it's you,
because you wanted it

1227
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:45,500
I shan't cry

1228
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,500
listen to me as you once did...

1229
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:56,700
when I told you
love was stirring in me

1230
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,800
now I tell you that it must die...

1231
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,900
so that I may live

1232
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:06,900
we needn't separate

1233
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:10,100
I took a long time,
but now you're my wife

1234
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,300
it's the first time
I've felt so sure...

1235
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,100
the very first time

1236
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:17,700
we made love...

1237
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,500
you may be pregnant

1238
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
we'll go to Brittany
and wait for the baby...

1239
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,600
by the sea

1240
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:29,400
I was meant to be a mother
and I will be

1241
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:32,400
but there's no room for me
in your life

1242
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:36,000
our love is a dead end,
but it's not shameful

1243
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:39,100
it mustn't be a dead end!

1244
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:41,900
I'm asking you to be my wife

1245
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:45,300
you never were
and never will be a husband

1246
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,500
I'll add this...

1247
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:50,500
my act was morally very serious...

1248
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:52,400
but it was my decision

1249
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:54,900
we're from different tribes...

1250
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:57,400
we learned different customs

1251
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:59,900
I'm a puritan in love...

1252
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,200
you love me
because you're a bit crazy

1253
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:05,900
please listen to me

1254
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,100
it's all true,
but I'm another person now...

1255
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:11,700
thanks to you

1256
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,500
you're not my Claude any more
and it's too late to change

1257
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,400
your value is in your work,
not in your children

1258
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,700
you were my center...

1259
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:25,200
and now I must lose you

1260
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,700
we love a person...

1261
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
for what he is.
We don't try to change him

1262
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,200
if we succeeded,
he'd no longer be himself

1263
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,600
you taught me love last night

1264
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,200
your kisses made me dizzy...

1265
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,600
I still hold you

1266
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:57,100
I can live without eyes or legs...
I can live without you

1267
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:00,000
I no longer fear life without you

1268
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:03,000
your ideas sway me
when I'm with you...

1269
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:06,500
afterward,
they shatter against my religion

1270
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:11,600
I'm not sad for you,
you don't need me

1271
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,300
god protect you

1272
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,000
Claude saw Muriel off

1273
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,900
they had half an hour
before her train

1274
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,600
Muriel seemed happy and confident

1275
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,700
she left and he was alone

1276
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:54,700
between them...

1277
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,300
was a dead girl they never named

1278
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,700
only a birth
could banish the ghost...

1279
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:02,300
by creating a different trio

1280
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:05,800
"dear Claude,
we knew it might happen...

1281
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,800
"and it did:
I'm expecting your child

1282
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,700
"praise god, you're alive in me

1283
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,200
"the paper is your flesh,
the ink, my blood

1284
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,500
"I press to make it enter"

1285
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,200
then she wrote again...

1286
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:33,400
this letter is bordered in black

1287
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,600
I'm not pregnant after all

1288
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:39,600
it was simply
my deep desire to be

1289
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:42,700
we shan't meet again,
however much I want to

1290
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:46,100
we couldn't surpass
our night in Calais

1291
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,700
we recognize happiness
only afterwards

1292
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:58,400
fifteen years have passed

1293
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,400
Muriel is married to a schoolteacher

1294
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,600
they have a daughter

1295
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,600
Mrs brown is dead, the house sold

1296
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,800
letters to the browns are returned

1297
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:12,300
fifteen years...

1298
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,800
France is snown
with corpses and shrapnel

1299
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
millions have died...
few remember why

1300
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,300
fifteen years...

1301
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,400
Claude visits the Rodin museum

1302
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,500
the statue of Balzac
is now acclaimed

1303
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,000
Claude hears English voices...

1304
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,800
schoolgirls, visiting France.
He remembers...

1305
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,200
Muriel's photo at ten...

1306
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,800
and looks for some resemblance

1307
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,700
could her daughter be there?

1308
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:51,700
This one?

1309
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,100
That one?

1310
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,400
Or the redhead?

1311
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,900
Claude looks at them

1312
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,600
he could ask:

1313
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:02,000
"Is one of you
Muriel brown's daughter?"

1314
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,000
No. What's the use...

1315
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:21,900
are you free?

1316
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:23,600
I have a fare

1317
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:30,000
what's wrong with me today?
I look old!


1
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,727
2 lbs. of tangerines please

2
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,132
There, Mademoiselle

3
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,296
No... it's Madame!

4
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:44,938
This magazine, please

5
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,257
That poster of Nureyev...

6
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,575
may I have it?

7
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,849
- Help yourself
- Lovely...

8
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,933
Terrific!

9
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,971
- How much?
- Two francs

10
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,090
Thank you...

11
00:01:59,299 --> 00:01:59,936
Mademoiselle...

12
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,051
No... it's Madame!

13
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,015
You go ahead, I'm slow

14
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,411
I'm late! I forgot the red

15
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,050
You're dyeing them red?

16
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:00,813
We did that at school:

17
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,375
We'd stick a flower in ink...

18
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,330
it'd turn black or blue

19
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:08,532
It was so messy we'd get hell!

20
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,889
They're turning red now

21
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:14,098
They're going to ban those products

22
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,617
I heard it on TV

23
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:16,935
What the hell for?

24
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,973
because of water pollution!

25
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,818
Shaving cream, too

26
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,169
From now on, only electric razors!

27
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:27,098
Look how red they are!

28
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,651
That was quick!

29
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,179
My immersion-heater...

30
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,769
Funny!
There's one that stays white...

31
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,776
Yes... and I don't know why

32
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,210
How's the artist?

33
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,012
Damn it, Ginette!

34
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,495
I pay you to work for me!

35
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,937
Know what I did?

36
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,211
Bought new pajamas

37
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,008
But I only kept the top

38
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:53,492
What do you say to that?

39
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:54,687
Not a thing!

40
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,366
You want an engraved invitation?

41
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:04,818
The flowers are here...

42
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,497
The blue are now red!

43
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,735
No... vice-versa!

44
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:12,377
It's an old story. I said...

45
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,491
"Mme Fournier, be nice..."

46
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,134
"My radio doesn't bother anyone"

47
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:21,810
She says: "So, sue me!"
After all, I pay big taxes, right?

48
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,692
She just makes buttonholes!

49
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,413
I should have sued her then...

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,009
10 years ago !

51
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,495
If I had it to do over...

52
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,850
They turned red!

53
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,012
You should go into business
for yourself

54
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,766
Telephone!

55
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:52,853
Hurry up!

56
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,968
I'll call her... hang on!

57
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,932
Oh, hello... Could you tell my wife
her mother's calling?

58
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,333
Hello mama...

59
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:32,610
I can't hear...

60
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,139
The garbage cans!

61
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,127
Tonight?

62
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:42,495
I'm sure we're free

63
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,771
Need anything?

64
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,216
Right... at 8:30!
See you tonight

65
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,249
We're invited to dinner at 8:15

66
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,735
I'll close up right away

67
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,937
I'll get you yet!

68
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,132
Give me a hand, please

69
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,935
Coming, dear!
I'm coming...

70
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,290
I'm almost ready!

71
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,927
You can set your clock by him

72
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,415
He's an opera singer:
always exits on cue!

73
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,052
You're neighbors, aren't you?

74
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,737
Same floor, next door

75
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,533
He's always right on time...

76
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,732
and always mad at his wife!

77
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,374
She's like your flowers...

78
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:51,298
A little red here,
a little blue there...

79
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,495
Look over there!

80
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:32,090
Christine, would you get the wine?

81
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,211
The personnel wanted to work!

82
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,898
Antoine, come help me

83
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,692
Go ahead...

84
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:58,855
That bottle, please

85
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,018
The Senator had a Mercedes...
a foreign car: bad politics!

86
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,177
So he got a CitroÎn
I got the Mercedes!

87
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,528
I can sell it

88
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,139
Striglias?

89
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,851
Striglias...
often confused with oubiglias

90
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,057
From my neighbor... Plates?

91
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,490
I thought you brought them...

92
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,370
for Mother's Day

93
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,017
Mother's Day?
I'm sorry, mama, I forgot!

94
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,849
Mother's Day is a Nazi invention...

95
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:52,572
Yes... during the war...

96
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,095
I put in aspirin

97
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,808
Aspirin in the water?

98
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:01,936
That's nonsense.
You should cut the stems

99
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,493
I do that too...

100
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,815
about 1/2 inch

101
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,658
Out of the water?

102
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,339
That's useless, too...

103
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:12,533
You have to cut them in the water,
so that...

104
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,139
no air gets in

105
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,094
The water goes straight up
to the flower

106
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:20,177
Your Japanese expert said that?

107
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,528
They know all about flowers

108
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,014
Floral art...

109
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,138
What about me?
Don't I get any soup?

110
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,769
I spoke to the Senator...

111
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,457
He might invest in your idea:

112
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,855
A self-service flower stand

113
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,894
I'm not interested anymore

114
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,613
I thought it over...

115
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,653
Too much spoilage...

116
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,849
right?

117
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:51,812
Except near a cemetery;
you could sell wreaths...

118
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,932
I've got a new interest...

119
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,777
A process to obtain Absolute Red

120
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,408
Too bad. The Senator loves flowers

121
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,417
Anyway...

122
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:10,697
he says you'll get a phone soon

123
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,211
Then pupils can call me directly!

124
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,216
You got the message? Marianne...

125
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:18,253
She came.
Her dentist cancelled

126
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,495
The little virtuoso...
who plays better than you?

127
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,099
Don't exaggerate!

128
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:28,086
She is gifted, but...
her mother forgets to pay and...

129
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,533
You won't ask? I will!

130
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,966
You're in the courtyard

131
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:36,695
I'll grab her coming out,
and ask her!

132
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,572
I've got an idea!

133
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,940
If she forgets, let her go

134
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,014
Just close the door.
Then play a tune so Antoine knows!

135
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,572
Play what?

136
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,610
- "River Kwai?"
- No, not that!

137
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,490
"Mademoiselle from Armentieres?"

138
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,177
Something livelier

139
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,095
"Autumn Leaves?"

140
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:04,014
Too slow!

141
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,129
"Carmen?"

142
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,687
"The Jewel Song?"

143
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,331
What's that?

144
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:15,609
"The Marseillaise!"

145
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,618
Of course!
"The Marseillaise?"

146
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,692
It's just right!

147
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,572
Oh, no! Can't be done...

148
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,494
You can't play it...
Not on a violin!

149
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,927
Why not?

150
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,859
Because:
"You can't fiddle around..."

151
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:34,620
"with a national anthem!"

152
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,412
Everyone knows that...

153
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:51,932
I'll get the light

154
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,370
Something's creepy about him

155
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,339
Doesn't Mme. Martin
know who he is?

156
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,451
No! He sublets. In 3 months...

157
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:21,378
he's had no visits, no mail!

158
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,288
Didn't you notice his hairy hands...

159
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,490
with forked fingers...

160
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,408
and sharp nails
that come out at night...

161
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,052
and grab at women's legs!

162
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,490
at women's legs!

163
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,135
Damn! I forgot the light

164
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,808
Don't look!

165
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,248
I'm reading

166
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:15,850
I think naked men are ugly!

167
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,052
How do women stand it?
Naked men are repulsive!

168
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,615
- Not all men...
- Yes, all men!

169
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,730
Except one!

170
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,339
That's true...

171
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,134
All... except one!

172
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,615
Who's the pin-up?

173
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,937
Nureyev.
A great dancer... and handsome

174
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,817
My poor breasts!

175
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,134
I can't breast-feed a child

176
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,495
Me neither!
Let him feed himself!

177
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:53,619
Let's see...

178
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:57,450
Let me see your breasts!
What's wrong with them?

179
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:01,691
Hey, they don't match!

180
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,618
You're crazy!

181
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,456
One's bigger than the other

182
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,570
It's not true

183
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,894
It is true!

184
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,293
Then it's normal!
Not at all...

185
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,768
If they had names they'd be...

186
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,413
Laurel... and Hardy!

187
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,298
Or maybe: Don Quixote...

188
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,456
and the little one: Sancho Panza

189
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,933
It's not funny!

190
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:32,370
A warm bed at night...

191
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,774
Get up! My pupil's coming

192
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:59,014
6 sheep, 5 sheep, 4 sheep, 3...

193
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,609
2... 1... zero sheep!

194
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,019
Hello Marianne

195
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,259
I'll call my wife

196
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,373
It's your pupil...

197
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,778
I'll leave you now...

198
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,898
Did you practice?

199
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,450
Your scales and "sostenuto"?

200
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,730
About an hour a day

201
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,452
Shall we start right in?

202
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,613
Think about your attacks,
and you tone

203
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,729
Anybody here?

204
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,130
Excuse me,
could you tell me...

205
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:38,659
Doinel!

206
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:42,295
- How are you?
- Same as always

207
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,453
What're you doing?

208
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,569
Coloring flowers

209
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,659
Your own business?

210
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,816
No... I work for a florist

211
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,770
Look like hard work

212
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,528
They say it takes
a lazy man to work hard

213
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,375
Married?

214
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,251
Yes, I live here...
Hear that violin?

215
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,894
My wife...
She gives lessons

216
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,419
Ah, a musician

217
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:05,415
You always did like music...

218
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,259
and nice bourgeois girls!

219
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,178
I never looked at it that way

220
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,731
For me,
it's not just the girl...

221
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,738
It's her family: father, mother...

222
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,214
I enjoy parents...
when they're not my own!

223
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,332
That your truck out front?

224
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,653
Can't park there

225
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,329
I gave you a ticket. Want two?

226
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,737
Sure, Dad, make it a pair!

227
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,536
I'm supposed to fix a TV set
You know a... Desdoigts?

228
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,808
M. Desbois... up there

229
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,612
That's funny...

230
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:48,897
Maybe he's gone out

231
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:52,135
I'd be surprised...
He hasn't, for 25 years

232
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:54,171
Sort of voluntary confinement

233
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,848
Says he won't go out till
Marshal who is...

234
00:18:58,058 --> 00:18:59,048
Marshal Juin?

235
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:03,137
No, the one who ran France
during the war

236
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:04,614
Marshal Petain!

237
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:09,976
Won't go out till Marshal Petain...
is buried in Verdun!

238
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:12,528
Where is he?

239
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:17,894
The TV repairman is here

240
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:19,931
About time! Hurry up!

241
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,459
Take it easy!

242
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,848
How's Josianne?

243
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,171
Didn't you marry her?

244
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,291
No. She quit work to marry...
an astronaut!

245
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,298
"Big pay and always away!"

246
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,136
She lives on Avenue Foch!

247
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:43,614
She's got it made!

248
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:47,971
He married her
because he knocked her up

249
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,057
I think she let herself...

250
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,410
because... yeah, you get me?

251
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,606
Excuse me... be right back!

252
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,567
You're getting good!

253
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:20,738
Thanks to Mme. Doinel...

254
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,337
I can never tell whether
it's my wife or Marianne playing

255
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:28,451
Soon you'll give the lessons...

256
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,615
and my wife will pay you!

257
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,451
Oh, I forgot to pay your wife!

258
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,173
It doesn't matter...

259
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,372
Yes, yes!
I forgot last time too!

260
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:39,730
No hurry...

261
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,576
Two lessons

262
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:43,419
Well, thank you... goodbye...

263
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,210
Hello... What's that?

264
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,136
A library staircase

265
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,410
You got 30 francs?

266
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:12,048
Heavy?

267
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,249
No...

268
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,126
What are you doing?

269
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,375
Practicing

270
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:43,011
Why up there?

271
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,448
To get used to heights

272
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,655
I got panicky at my last concert...

273
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,009
Iooking into the orchestra pit

274
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,810
I was really just dizzy...

275
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,612
so I'm practicing

276
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,538
What are you doing!

277
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,012
I'm thinking...

278
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,053
I'll bet!.. Let me get down

279
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,411
Close your eyes

280
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,019
Oh, no! I know you!

281
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,814
Nothing's further from my mind...

282
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,337
I won't touch you!

283
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:08,131
Promise?

284
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:09,567
Scout's honor!

285
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,336
You were never a boy scout!

286
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,415
You bet I wasn't!

287
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:15,053
Close your eyes!

288
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,173
Eyes closed?

289
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,575
Now open them

290
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,449
What's that?

291
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,570
A library staircase.
I've always wanted one

292
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:40,611
We don't have a library!

293
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,890
Have to begin somewhere...

294
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,856
I have a surprise for you...

295
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:50,336
The Senator came through!
We've got our telephone!

296
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:53,854
Not bad...

297
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,855
I told Lucien
you'd write the Senator

298
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:00,813
Before I thank him... does it work?

299
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,009
What do I dial to find out the time?

300
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,368
Odeon 84-00

301
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:14,814
Cochin Hospital?

302
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,692
Sorry, wrong number!

303
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:19,295
I got a hospital!

304
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,490
Dial the hospital
and see what you get

305
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,538
How's the letter?

306
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:27,054
Almost finished

307
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,534
Can I read it?

308
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,690
"Thanks for getting us,
in one week..."

309
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,173
"what others wait years for!"

310
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,496
You can't send that!

311
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,894
It's true, isn't it?

312
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:39,613
Listen!

313
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,855
He's Lucien's customer...
You can't do that!

314
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,367
I can't?.. Then you write him!

315
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,730
I will!
You're a selfish monster!

316
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,327
Everybody has to help you!

317
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,411
I didn't ask for anything

318
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:57,212
I didn't want the damn telephone!

319
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,538
Why?
Because friends might call us?

320
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,729
What if we're bored?

321
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,692
I don't know what boredom is!

322
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,616
I know some people get bored...

323
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:08,730
but I don't know what it means!

324
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,931
There's always something to do...

325
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,017
cut the pages of a book...

326
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,179
do crossword puzzles, take notes...
always something to do!

327
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,373
I'd like a 30-hour day...
because I'm never bored!

328
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:25,256
I wish I were 60...

329
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,096
I'd only need 5 hours sleep!

330
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,450
I'm going to the toilet!

331
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:38,251
Going to school?
Aren't you on strike?

332
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:43,056
You're an early bird...

333
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:45,615
- It's cold...
- Want a set of keys?

334
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,890
Anyway, they're right here

335
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,457
Give me a hand...

336
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,173
Get a move on, Marcel!

337
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,535
No more noise?

338
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,459
They're plastic...

339
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,375
On wheels?

340
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:04,333
No!
The new management got them...

341
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:06,178
they're noiseless!

342
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,653
You look nervous

343
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,009
I'm testing a product I invented

344
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,049
If it works,
I get Absolute Red...

345
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,772
If not, I read the want ads!

346
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:26,537
I studied our horoscope.
Very favorable!

347
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:30,096
Big things ahead for you and me

348
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,172
I used too much...

349
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,940
What do you think?

350
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:52,169
Read the want ads!

351
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,371
Important new
American hydraulic company...

352
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:06,897
seeks dynamic
young man speaking English...

353
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:58,451
"Dear sir:
I wish to recommend..."

354
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,250
"the son of an old friend."

355
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,373
"Former Scout leader
and a loyal Frenchman...

356
00:27:04,618 --> 00:27:06,690
"he is completely fluent in..."

357
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,016
the language of Shakespeare."

358
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:22,019
"His dynamism should be useful
to your firm."

359
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,010
Could you give this letter to the
director?

360
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,057
You can come in now

361
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,928
Just a minute

362
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:12,653
The applicant is here

363
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,055
- Say hello first
- Hello! Now hurry up

364
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,613
Monsieur Max, please

365
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:19,776
- My little cream puff!
- Down, boy!

366
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,411
Monsieur Max?.. He's here

367
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,210
Watch out! I love cream puffs!

368
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,012
If I had breasts
I'd fondle them all day

369
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,815
A very nice letter...

370
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:44,607
You speak...

371
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,096
You speak English well?

372
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,135
A little...

373
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,816
You read it better than you speak it

374
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,492
The problem...

375
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,218
for our employees here...

376
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,980
is transportation.
You have a car?

377
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:36,213
You can't start at the top,
of course

378
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,775
I'll put you on the scale-models

379
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,377
We've made a model of a harbor...

380
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:57,855
with the port installations

381
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:00,938
You'll maneuver the boats...

382
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,050
Like the job?

383
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,614
You'll see: my employees...

384
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:11,730
are so happy here...

385
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,613
they hate to stay home on Sundays!

386
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,335
That is the port...

387
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,171
based on future plans

388
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,769
At present, the harbor silts up

389
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,731
So we've built a dike
from there to there

390
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,939
Otherwise, it's accurate to scale

391
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,332
Your job will be...

392
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:35,815
to run the boats by remote control

393
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:39,336
Push a button and away they go!

394
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,127
Like the job?

395
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,296
"You'll see: my employees..."

396
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,897
"are so happy here..."

397
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:47,170
"they hate to stay home Sundays!"

398
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,575
He says that to all the new ones!

399
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:58,410
Imagine writing that
in a newspaper!

400
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:00,938
Listen: it's about...

401
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,700
the Common Market, in Brussels

402
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,778
"Afterwards, in their rooms..."

403
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,971
"each delegate found..."

404
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,817
"a sensuous call-girl awaiting him!"

405
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,249
Impossible!

406
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,768
It's true!

407
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,895
Imagine... in Le Monde!

408
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,776
"each delegate found..."

409
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,335
"a sensuous call-girl awaiting him!"

410
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:23,211
It's not true!

411
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,897
Read it yourself

412
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,606
"each delegate found a sumptuous..."

413
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:32,095
"collation awaiting him!"

414
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:33,813
You liar!

415
00:31:35,578 --> 00:31:36,647
Lights out

416
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,009
Got you, huh?

417
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,210
Got to tell you something tomorrow

418
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:44,288
Tomorrow...

419
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,171
Why not now?

420
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,731
You couldn't sleep

421
00:31:57,778 --> 00:31:58,769
I bought some

422
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,374
A new brand

423
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:12,816
First-class!

424
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,056
Damn! There's a guy I know

425
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:25,054
Owes me money.
He'll be embarrassed...

426
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,971
I owe you 30 francs, right?

427
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,096
You lend me 20 more...

428
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:37,575
you get the 50 back all at once

429
00:32:58,098 --> 00:32:59,169
Well, so long...

430
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,731
Where's your violin?

431
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,337
It's not a lesson

432
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,693
Where you going?

433
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,016
Do you always tell me where you go?

434
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:08,732
See you tonight

435
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,018

00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:56,088

00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,337
"go on! Go on..."

441
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:07,815
"Stay relaxed... very good,
very good..."

442
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,934
"Go on, go on, go on!"

443
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,409
I have something for you

444
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,257
Advertising...

445
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:00,617
Looks like Mme Doinel...

446
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,253
got stung by a mosquito

447
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,054
That was no mosquito!

448
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,612
Look! The strangler!

449
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,929
Looks mean...

450
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,851
I'm coming, dear!

451
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,692
It's soon, isn't it?

452
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,538
You're so lucky!

453
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:42,411
M. Doinel?.. Not here

454
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,489
Don't hang up!

455
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,293
The hospital?

456
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,735
I'll give him the message

457
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,972
A girl or a boy?

458
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,898
Call Antoine!

459
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:07,777
It's a boy!

460
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,887
Antoine... congratulations!

461
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:29,255
It's a lovely little boy

462
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,938
He's under the sign of Aquarius

463
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:33,175
He's in the arms of Morpheus!

464
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,494
Dine with us?

465
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:36,849
I'll stay with Christine

466
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:38,731
Go on... she's waiting

467
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,693
Not even one flower!

468
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,858
He came as soon as they called!

469
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,572
He had no time!

470
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,248
Let's get them the extra room

471
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,132
Knock out the wall...
it'll be perfect

472
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:56,496
Hold his head up!

473
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,338
What a terrific child!

474
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,300
Of course, I knew he would be...

475
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:05,608
He'll be the writer I wanted to be

476
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,617
Victor Hugo or nothing!

477
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:12,659
What Napoleon did with the sword...

478
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,338
you'll do with the pen!

479
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,777
He smiled at me, before...

480
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,699
Babies only smile after 3 weeks!

481
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,659
He smiled at me!

482
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,938
A photographer's here
to take pictures

483
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,693
I'm too tired now

484
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,494
But I'm not too tired!

485
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,175
Send him in...

486
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,414
I'd like to be alone now

487
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,496
You can eat with my parents

488
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,251
I turned them down to stay with you

489
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:11,088
I can tell you a story,

490
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,813
or we can listen to the radio...

491
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:13,974
Go away!

492
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:19,295
Please...

493
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,454
See you tomorrow

494
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,612
Tonight, I didn't...

495
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,809
want to leave you by yourself

496
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,534
I waited for the child by myself!

497
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,132
Good news: I'm a father!

498
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,172
It's a boy

499
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,052
- Happy?
- And how!

500
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,659
I owe you 50 frs, right?

501
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,577
Lend me 50 more?
I'll pay you 100...

502
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,293
in a lump sum...

503
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:38,054
- You must be real happy!
- And how!

504
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,333
Is Jean there?

505
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,853
May I speak to Jean?

506
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,489
Tell him
Antoine Doinel is a father...

507
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,655
Tell him I have a little boy...

508
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,612
Don't forget...

509
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,418
You have to register his birth...

510
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,492
We ought to decide...

511
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,896
I prefer Ghislain

512
00:41:08,018 --> 00:41:09,612
It's pretentious:

513
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,614
"Little Lord Fauntleroy"

514
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,936
Got a better idea?

515
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,454
Alphonse...

516
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:19,938
I like Alphonse...

517
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,132
Makes him sound like a peasant

518
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,331
I have an uncle Ghislain...

519
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,494
Mother: Christine Darbon Doinel...

520
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:32,811
The baby's name?

521
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,773
Alphonse

522
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,056
How'd it go?

523
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,452
It's a boy

524
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,652
How'd it go?

525
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,690
Difficult, at first...

526
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,128
but she's fine now

527
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,853
Congratulations!

528
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,175
Give me a hand

529
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,253
I'm glad it's a boy

530
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,898
- Still by yourself?
- For another week...

531
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:03,739
You must be lonely up there,
in bed...

532
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,851
at night, alone...

533
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,978
No, no... I'm fine!

534
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,849
Is he cute?

535
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:12,369
All pink, with tiny hands...

536
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:13,773
Congratulations!

537
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,373
His eyes're open

538
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:18,688
Who's he look like?

539
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,210
Watch out for him:
lot of kidnappings lately!

540
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,775
The strangler...

541
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,652
We call him that, too

542
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,452
Don't stare!

543
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:32,333
Right...
Drinks on the house!

544
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,052
On the house?

545
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,498
A real "blessed event!"

546
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:38,690
Everybody... even you!

547
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:15,652
There, it's done!

548
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,012
Have to be in shape!

549
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,657
Terrific!

550
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,853
- Like it, Sylvana?
- Extraordinary!

551
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,898
That'll be our room

552
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:34,612
No street noise...

553
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,259
I can wave from my window

554
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,335
The baby's room'll be there

555
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,409
So you like it?

556
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:47,927
Terrific!

557
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:03,617
I have to get dinner ready

558
00:44:12,018 --> 00:44:13,009
I saw you!

559
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,896
You go for her, eh?

560
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,335
Sylvana, that's who!

561
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:20,577
You go for her!

562
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:22,971
A nice buxom Italian...

563
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:24,295
sexy mouth!

564
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,614
You bastard...

565
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,811
Remember our first kiss?

566
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:40,771
I was petrified!

567
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,289
What?.. You did it all!

568
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,773
You're mistaken...

569
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,697
I remember very well...

570
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:48,858
We were in a taxi

571
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:51,614
It stopped. I leaned over...

572
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,572
to give you a little goodnight kiss

573
00:44:55,018 --> 00:44:57,135
I saw your lips part

574
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,170
I said to myself...

575
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,777
This is it!

576
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,492
You're out of your mind!

577
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:06,170
I liked it,
but you took the initiative...

578
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,777
That's your story!

579
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,255
You grabbed me... and I let you

580
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,179
It wasn't that way at all!

581
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,416
Here's exactly how you were...

582
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:17,893
Your head thrown back...

583
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:20,614
eyes closed,
lips slightly open...

584
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,411
like this...

585
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:28,496
You'd thought about it

586
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:31,971
About us kissing, one day

587
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:34,090
All girls think about that

588
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,813
They do, eh?

589
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:37,657
So you admit it!

590
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:49,579
I'll take Ghislain now

591
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,293
He didn't cry once

592
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,492
Good.
I can work at home again soon

593
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,773
You have some mail

594
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:02,052
It's a certificate

595
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,215
You named him Alphonse?

596
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:05,849
Look...

597
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,215
Antoine did it!

598
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:10,132
He won't get away with it!

599
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,614
He knew I didn't want that name!

600
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,411
I'd lay her badly
but I'd lay her gladly!

601
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,849
Alphonse'll be a great writer

602
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,291
Know what I'm going to do?

603
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,172
Educate him myself...

604
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,768
at home.
Alphonse'll only learn...

605
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,333
important things!

606
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:39,574
We'll see...

607
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,657
Come, Ghislain...

608
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,010
Alphonse!

609
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,132
Pretty little bottom...

610
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,059
Alphonse?
Just like his mother!

611
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,369
Watch papa...

612
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,730
He's going to the bathroom...

613
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:03,777
It's an arctic expedition!

614
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,570
Look...

615
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,891
A flashlight...

616
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:08,574
A book...

617
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,818
Uncut pages, so...

618
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,172
a knife!

619
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,849
Now what?

620
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,898
A newspaper!

621
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,295
- You forgot to go shopping
- For what?

622
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:31,898
I left you a list

623
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,090
I didn't see any list

624
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,210
There's nothing to eat!

625
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,338
I wrote it all down for you

626
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,172
Get Mme Martin...

627
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,052
to baby-sit. We'll go out

628
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,213
She's not home

629
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,451
Nothing at all?

630
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,809
Only baby-food

631
00:47:50,018 --> 00:47:51,931
Yummy! Let's eat that

632
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,175
If he wakes up...

633
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,530
You know Alphonse never wakes up!

634
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,297
We'll buy more tomorrow

635
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,978
Tonight, we eat!

636
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,132
Theater Tonight,
live from Marienbad

637
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,536
Look... The Strangler!

638
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,132
Did you know he was on TV?

639
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,978
No. Is he a singer?

640
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:32,295
He does imitations!

641
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,293
You kept an old picture of me...

642
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,576
Not bad, eh?

643
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,288
Last year...

644
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:45,938
was it in Carlsbad... or Marienbad?

645
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,094
Once again I walk through
the drawing rooms...

646
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,610
the long corridors...

647
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:56,572
luxurious, lugubrious...

648
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:01,090
I am not an apparition

649
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,655
I am a woman, which is...

650
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:05,858
just the opposite!

651
00:49:06,139 --> 00:49:08,699
You say I'm exceptional...

652
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:11,414
You're right, I am!

653
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,577
He saw you last night!

654
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,733
Terrific!

655
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,692
Why didn't you tell us...

656
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,130
you were a comedian!

657
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:13,898
Need some help, Doinel?

658
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:16,927
THE NEXT MORNING

659
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,338
Remember me?

660
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:51,974
I brought you something

661
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,451
Come in

662
00:54:00,139 --> 00:54:02,016
You noticed?

663
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,137
I saw it fall in the water

664
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:07,815
Why didn't you say anything?

665
00:54:08,018 --> 00:54:11,806
Because the man said
the model was fragile

666
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:15,179
I was sorry about the bracelet

667
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,655
But I didn't want to bother you

668
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,373
I thought you'd want it

669
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,733
Mlle Maki, my roommate

670
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:57,052
Won't you sit down?

671
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,496
I'm sorry, I have to go...

672
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:01,815
We were just having tea...

673
00:55:02,018 --> 00:55:03,657
I'm already late...

674
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:15,219
I'll show you out

675
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,692
We never see you any more

676
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,697
You like working for the Americans?

677
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,972
Yes. It gives me time to think

678
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,498
I'm writing a novel

679
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:52,530
No kidding!

680
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:55,172
My wife doesn't know.
I write at night

681
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,893
A novelist? Like Baudelaire...

682
00:55:58,099 --> 00:55:59,692
He started with flowers, too

683
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,572
He didn't write novels

684
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,088
What about "Flowers of Evil?"

685
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,777
That's poetry

686
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,447
I know more about him than you

687
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:10,489
I just read an article

688
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:13,213
You know he was a priest's son?

689
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:17,010
His father was an ordained priest

690
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:19,255
Then he worked for a family:

691
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,496
Choiseul-Praslin...

692
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:23,452
as a tutor...

693
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:25,731
Open the door

694
00:56:26,018 --> 00:56:28,010
What's your novel about?

695
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,849
Life in general... my youth...

696
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,574
From the particular
to the general...

697
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,929
Oh? Well, we'll have to read it

698
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,172
I get an autographed copy, right?

699
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,494
"For Cesarin"

700
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,929
What's the title?

701
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,697
Haven't found one yet

702
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,016
It shouldn't be hard...

703
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,849
Any trumpets in your novel?

704
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,213
Any drums?

705
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:56,731
Then call it:
"Neither Trumpets nor Drums!"

706
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:00,059
Not bad, eh?

707
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:06,974
What do you want?

708
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:08,407
We're closed...

709
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:11,088
What are you looking for?

710
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,929
A fight!

711
00:57:19,099 --> 00:57:23,059
This is a little place...
no action...

712
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,534
We cater to old folks and children

713
00:57:26,018 --> 00:57:28,739
You don't want to fight them, right?

714
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,697
If you want a fight,
there's a cafe...

715
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,733
at the corner. You'll get...

716
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,931
what you're looking for!

717
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:46,889
What's that?

718
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:49,016
"Japanese Women?"

719
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,972
I need it for my work

720
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:58,248
Let's see...

721
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:01,289
You look good in glasses

722
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,931
I don't like them

723
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:06,889
I've finished

724
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,690
I know why you like glasses...

725
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,492
She wore them

726
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:20,376
Who?

727
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:22,297
Your first girl

728
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,338
No she didn't

729
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:25,893
I thought she did

730
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,659
She made you suffer...

731
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,934
She had me doing in circles!

732
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:33,695
What a nightmare!

733
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:37,458
Then, one night, it was all over

734
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,777
At 8 PM, I loved her...

735
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,130
By 9 PM, I couldn't stand her

736
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,375
I was cured!

737
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:45,536
She said the wrong thing...

738
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:46,855
Exactly...

739
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,737
And I can't even remember what

740
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:51,416
It was a relief

741
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,168
If I ask something, will you do it?

742
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,414
It depends...

743
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,012
Quibbling already!

744
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:03,414
Will you do it?

745
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:04,735
Ask me!

746
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:08,050
Put your glasses on again?

747
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,693
- Am I too early?
- Not at all...

748
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,018
What shall we do tonight?

749
01:00:00,219 --> 01:00:02,652
I thought we'd go to a movie

750
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,090
I haven't picked one out yet,
though...

751
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,139
I thought
we might have dinner here...

752
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,489
That'd be fine

753
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:15,260
We could go to a movie after

754
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:21,094
I'll be right back

755
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:09,657
My friend is so sorry.
Her mother is sick...

756
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,056
so she can't stay

757
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,496
I hope it's not too serious

758
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:16,577
Her mother is very sick!

759
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,898
She has to leave right away

760
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,498
DO NOT DISTURB

761
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:24,730
Did you just get home?

762
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,652
We worked late

763
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:28,699
Look at the time!

764
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,697
I had to eat, didn't I?

765
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:33,737
He tiptoes in...

766
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,498
but I'm awake!

767
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:38,134
3 AM! I want an explanation...

768
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,818
Know what he says?

769
01:02:40,018 --> 01:02:41,851
"I had to eat, didn't I!"

770
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:44,768
"Kyoko loves Antoine"

771
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:56,172
"Come when you can, but can soon"

772
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:07,215
"She says goodnight
and thinks of Antoine"

773
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,172
This just came

774
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,414
Who's it for?

775
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:24,655
I don't know

776
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:26,175
Must be for you

777
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,690
No one would send me flowers here

778
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,489
Must be for Nicole

779
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:32,735
I don't know...

780
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:34,333
Oh, maybe...

781
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:37,373
For you?..
You must be dreaming!

782
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:39,137
For me, maybe?

783
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:42,614
It's hard to read...

784
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,650
written very small...

785
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,217
It's for Doinel!

786
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,492
- What floor?
- Ground floor

787
01:04:44,659 --> 01:04:46,139
Was someone with you?

788
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,534
No, no one...

789
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,568
What's that?

790
01:04:53,179 --> 01:04:55,056
Can I see Alphonse, please?

791
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,409
He's in there

792
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,092
Look at what he brought

793
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,255
I know about them...

794
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,893
They were for you... I lost them...

795
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:07,179
then I thought
it would look silly...

796
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,217
I'm delighted!

797
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,934
Have you forgotten we're going out?

798
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,695
I haven't forgotten... I can't

799
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,936
We're all night...
testing, tonight...

800
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:20,536
And what's this?

801
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:22,378
Nose?.. "Hana"

802
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:26,139
"Hana"... not bad

803
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:31,614
You answer the phone
with "Machi machi"

804
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,253
What does that mean?

805
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,257
No... it's "Mochi mochi"

806
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,099
It means "Hello"

807
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:42,094
Then if you say "Hello, hello"...

808
01:05:42,659 --> 01:05:45,014
it's four "mochis?"

809
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,938
No, just two!

810
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,737
This is nice, isn't it?

811
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:07,532
If I commit suicide with someone...

812
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,413
I'd like it to be you

813
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:45,378
Her name is Kyoko, she loves you"

814
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:25,338
If she were just another woman...

815
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,532
but she's not.
She's another world...

816
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,731
You see what I mean?

817
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,775
What's that?

818
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:36,856
A lesson...

819
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:38,288
At this hour?

820
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:41,891
What's that: your violin?

821
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,489
I'm going.
I'll get Alphonse tomorrow

822
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,168
Listen, I'll sleep in the chair...

823
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,858
you can have the bed

824
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:50,731
Not in the same room!

825
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,293
All right!

826
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,056
Not in the same room!

827
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,934
What a mess!

828
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,931
You left without
waking me this morning!

829
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,015
Mind if I kiss Alphonse?

830
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,207
We had to talk...

831
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,095
remember?

832
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,368
We'll always have time to talk!

833
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:30,850
Besides, I was late for work

834
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,493
Your parents are coming
for dinner... and to see the baby

835
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,417
Didn't you say no?

836
01:08:38,618 --> 01:08:39,939
How could I?

837
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,810
You're out of your mind!

838
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,055
I haven't told mother...

839
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,939
Call them! Call it off!

840
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,287
It's too late

841
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,331
They've left by now

842
01:08:50,538 --> 01:08:52,212
They'll understand...

843
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,376
when they see all this!

844
01:08:54,578 --> 01:08:56,694
You're disgusting!

845
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,698
What'll my mother think?

846
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:03,809
Help me!

847
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,412
My manuscript!

848
01:09:10,658 --> 01:09:12,457
A lot you care!

849
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,453
We invited ourselves

850
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:30,139
Here, take this...

851
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,733
Let's see Alphonse

852
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:33,770
What's that?

853
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,692
A duck for Alphonse

854
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,411
- Anything wrong?
- I'm fine...

855
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,215
I'm fine!

856
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:44,849
The duck isn't for you!

857
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:48,969
You see,
I just read a novel called:

858
01:09:49,698 --> 01:09:51,131
"The Mischievous Duck"

859
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,774
It's about a judge
who falls in love...

860
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:57,050
with a duck, like this...

861
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,930
his son's toy!

862
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,698
Couldn't happen to Antoine

863
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:04,287
He loves people, not things...

864
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,332
though he's very partial to yellow!

865
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,698
Just look at him!

866
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:11,219
He's cute!

867
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:12,849
He's grown...

868
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,051
Look at the duck!

869
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,099
Come to mama...

870
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,934
He wants to walk... watch!

871
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,890
He's too young!

872
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,095
He is not amused!

873
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,448
I'll call you

874
01:10:33,538 --> 01:10:34,288
Good...

875
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,649
Sorry about tonight... I was tired

876
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:43,657
We all were...

877
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:46,087
Don't catch cold

878
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,576
Help me with the mattress

879
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,698
Must we do this?

880
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,895
If I sleep next to you...

881
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,613
the world won't end!

882
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:01,014
I'm not like you!

883
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,893
I hate what is vague... elusive...

884
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,497
ambiguous...

885
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,011
I like what is clear!

886
01:11:10,578 --> 01:11:13,729
Don't come near me...
don't touch me!

887
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,648
That's the way you want it!

888
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,453
All right!

889
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,448
Goodbye!

890
01:12:29,572 --> 01:12:31,288
TUESDAY

891
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:56,720
THURSDAY

892
01:13:21,091 --> 01:13:22,002
SATURDAY

893
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:55,604
I don't know what I'm going to do

894
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,243
You're living alone?

895
01:13:57,452 --> 01:13:58,439
More or less...

896
01:13:58,652 --> 01:14:00,243
Doesn't it bother you?

897
01:14:00,452 --> 01:14:02,680
I don't mind solitude

898
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:03,845
When I'm alone...

899
01:14:04,051 --> 01:14:05,770
at night... I'm afraid

900
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:08,439
I'd marry a streetlight
if it could talk!

901
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:13,206
Oh, it's you...

902
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:15,960
Antoine came yesterday, so...

903
01:14:16,212 --> 01:14:18,725
Believe me, he'll come back

904
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,158
I don't think so

905
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,770
I handled it badly

906
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,926
Instead of smoothing it over...

907
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:26,520
I panicked and made it worse

908
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:30,087
It takes patience.
All men are children

909
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,529
I thought you loved her?

910
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:33,926
Very much!

911
01:14:34,692 --> 01:14:37,569
At first I couldn't get over
her good manners

912
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,201
So polite!
Funny, yet touching...

913
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,524
Then it got on my nerves!

914
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:44,404
"Thank you for this..."

915
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:47,251
"Thank you for that..."

916
01:14:47,452 --> 01:14:49,328
"Thanks one and all!"

917
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,761
I called her "Peggy Proper"

918
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:55,884
Peggy,
because of her British reserve....

919
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,198
Proper, because she was!

920
01:14:59,091 --> 01:15:01,002
Know what I mean?

921
01:15:02,212 --> 01:15:04,725
I was a virgin...
I'm not proud of it!

922
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:06,649
I dated as much as I wanted

923
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,966
But I was scared and ignorant...

924
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,002
Imagine: a virgin at 20!

925
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:13,042
I was a living anachronism!

926
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:16,564
I had false ideas about life, too...

927
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,319
But it is fascinating!

928
01:15:19,652 --> 01:15:20,926
No, the truth is...

929
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:23,247
that life is disgusting!

930
01:15:23,532 --> 01:15:25,283
You should see her smoke!

931
01:15:26,452 --> 01:15:27,885
She doesn't know how

932
01:15:28,532 --> 01:15:31,363
Like an awkward little girl...

933
01:15:31,572 --> 01:15:33,448
acting grown up!

934
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:35,689
He's really funny

935
01:15:36,171 --> 01:15:38,242
And I'm never bored, with him

936
01:15:39,652 --> 01:15:41,085
Those colds of his!

937
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:43,520
At first, when he'd sniffle...

938
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:46,292
I wanted to say:
"Blow your nose!"

939
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:49,368
Now, when he doesn't sniffle...

940
01:15:49,572 --> 01:15:51,403
I think he's sick!

941
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:54,805
My husband!

942
01:17:01,131 --> 01:17:02,359
Was Alphonse good?

943
01:17:02,572 --> 01:17:05,769
Fine!
He smiles and blows kisses...

944
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,404
You noticed...

945
01:17:09,252 --> 01:17:10,922
Did you see his tooth?

946
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:14,009
A little tooth!

947
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,884
I packed your summer clothes

948
01:17:19,091 --> 01:17:21,447
I'll get them another time

949
01:17:22,212 --> 01:17:24,328
Hook me up. I'm late...

950
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,922
He's playing with a program, okay?

951
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:33,279
No! He'll tear it

952
01:17:33,492 --> 01:17:35,960
I went to the ballet...

953
01:17:37,212 --> 01:17:38,884
What's written on it?

954
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:41,127
Nureyev's autograph...

955
01:17:41,332 --> 01:17:43,480
We went backstage afterwards

956
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,523
That's so provincial!

957
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:48,451
Bothering a guy
who's danced for 2 hours!

958
01:17:48,652 --> 01:17:50,845
Now don't start that!

959
01:17:55,652 --> 01:17:57,288
I'm ready to baby-sit

960
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:00,046
Am I too early? I can come back...

961
01:18:00,252 --> 01:18:01,082
Not at all!

962
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:19,051
To baby-sit

963
01:18:29,612 --> 01:18:34,002
A taxi, please: 17 rue Descazes

964
01:18:37,332 --> 01:18:39,448
Six minutes?... Thank you

965
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:43,600
I'm going out...

966
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:46,372
But you can stay with Alphonse...

967
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,603
I'll walk you down

968
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,239
Goodnight... Be good

969
01:18:56,332 --> 01:18:58,207
Watch TV if you like

970
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:00,368
Take care of him

971
01:19:04,412 --> 01:19:05,890
Here, this is yours

972
01:19:06,252 --> 01:19:07,890
I gave it to you

973
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,243
It's yours!

974
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:24,010
Remember how you used to say:

975
01:19:24,212 --> 01:19:27,680
"Take your keys in case we fight?"

976
01:19:31,212 --> 01:19:33,282
You're in a good mood

977
01:19:33,492 --> 01:19:34,605
Surprised?

978
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:37,006
Coming here, you think...

979
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:40,203
"She's going to yell at me again!"

980
01:19:40,412 --> 01:19:42,368
- Admit it!
- It's not so!

981
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,412
- You mustn't...
- Oh? I thought...

982
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:48,649
I just thought...

983
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:53,886
Let me go!

984
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:55,247
I was just helping...

985
01:19:55,452 --> 01:19:56,885
I don't need help!

986
01:19:57,452 --> 01:19:58,850
You're a pain!

987
01:19:59,051 --> 01:20:00,609
A real pain!

988
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,768
All you know is what you want!

989
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,404
A kiss when you want it!

990
01:20:04,612 --> 01:20:06,568
Solitude when you want it!

991
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,488
I'm not "yours to command!"

992
01:20:08,692 --> 01:20:09,568
Not any more!

993
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:10,488
Shut up!

994
01:20:13,292 --> 01:20:14,884
I'm sorry...

995
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:17,603
I understand...

996
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:19,564
Oh, I know that line:

997
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,886
"I'm too rotten..."

998
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:22,844
"for a girl like you!"

999
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:24,041
I'd never pull that

1000
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,127
You have... 100 times!

1001
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:28,444
Put it in your novel!

1002
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:32,488
Well, the truth is...

1003
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:35,211
it's all I think about

1004
01:20:35,412 --> 01:20:37,287
That's why I'm so fouled up

1005
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:42,163
Once it's done,
we'll get along better

1006
01:20:48,572 --> 01:20:51,404
Don't send me a copy,
I won't read it

1007
01:20:54,091 --> 01:20:57,323
You're getting even
with your parents...

1008
01:20:57,532 --> 01:20:59,443
washing dirty linen in public

1009
01:20:59,652 --> 01:21:01,688
I'm not smart but I know this!

1010
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,801
Writing to settle old scores...

1011
01:21:04,011 --> 01:21:05,161
isn't art!

1012
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:08,328
I've wondered about that

1013
01:21:08,532 --> 01:21:10,648
That's what's bothering me

1014
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:14,286
Do what you must
but leave me alone

1015
01:21:15,372 --> 01:21:17,840
I've never had much pride, so...

1016
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:20,965
I can say this: I still love you

1017
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,729
But I'd rather not see you

1018
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:27,162
You can see the baby,
but I won't be home

1019
01:21:28,652 --> 01:21:30,131
The taxi's coming...

1020
01:21:39,452 --> 01:21:40,600
Where's that cab?

1021
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:42,529
They said 6 minutes...

1022
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:46,444
Anyway, I hope you're happy

1023
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,484
I don't think about it

1024
01:21:49,692 --> 01:21:52,252
It can't work.
We hardly talk now

1025
01:21:52,452 --> 01:21:53,770
You can always smile

1026
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,451
That's all we do!

1027
01:21:55,652 --> 01:21:58,006
By evening, I have lock-jaw...

1028
01:21:58,212 --> 01:21:59,609
from smiling!

1029
01:22:00,091 --> 01:22:03,127
Restaurants are hell!
Between courses...

1030
01:22:03,332 --> 01:22:05,527
I'm expected to make small talk

1031
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:08,765
I can't even eat!
It's awful...

1032
01:22:09,332 --> 01:22:12,163
She thinks I've gone away for 3 days

1033
01:22:12,372 --> 01:22:13,689
I pity you!

1034
01:22:16,091 --> 01:22:16,921
Where you going?

1035
01:22:18,492 --> 01:22:20,287
I don't know...

1036
01:22:21,051 --> 01:22:22,326
Can I drop you off?

1037
01:22:22,532 --> 01:22:23,680
No, I'm okay...

1038
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,086
Just a minute

1039
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:28,645
Do you want me to stay with you?

1040
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:31,087
Want to go to a movie?

1041
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:34,725
No, I'll just go for a walk

1042
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,926
You're sweet...

1043
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:43,359
Kiss me...

1044
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:54,247
You are my sister,
my daughter, my mother...

1045
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:56,520
I'd hoped to be your wife...

1046
01:23:36,412 --> 01:23:38,323
Wait for me here...

1047
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,569
No, no...
I'll be right back!

1048
01:24:11,412 --> 01:24:13,685
Don't you like any of them?

1049
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,609
I didn't know it was like this...

1050
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,484
It's very simple:

1051
01:24:18,692 --> 01:24:21,649
You look and choose... then...

1052
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:35,681
Follow me...

1053
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:50,328
It's slow, right now

1054
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:52,841
We used to be busy till the 23rd

1055
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:55,805
Now, everyone's broke by the 15th

1056
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:57,411
The Administration!

1057
01:24:57,612 --> 01:25:01,364
When I saw them on TV,
I knew we'd had it!

1058
01:25:01,652 --> 01:25:03,368
Not interested in politics?

1059
01:25:03,572 --> 01:25:04,925
A little...

1060
01:25:05,492 --> 01:25:07,323
Anyway, I agree with you:

1061
01:25:07,532 --> 01:25:09,170
They're all bums

1062
01:25:09,492 --> 01:25:12,368
Some bums
cost us more than others

1063
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:15,362
"If you don't follow politics..."

1064
01:25:15,572 --> 01:25:18,368
"politics will get you in the end!"

1065
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:21,368
The end of the month,
the ends to an end...

1066
01:25:21,572 --> 01:25:24,131
the end of a film...
I hate all endings!

1067
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:25,605
What's that?

1068
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:26,801
Nothing...

1069
01:25:27,011 --> 01:25:30,047
I said...
you are especially beautiful

1070
01:25:51,492 --> 01:25:53,448
Walking in your sleep?

1071
01:25:53,652 --> 01:25:55,368
Glad to see you...

1072
01:25:58,212 --> 01:25:59,962
Nothing like a good house...

1073
01:26:00,171 --> 01:26:02,402
to complete a happy home!

1074
01:26:23,652 --> 01:26:26,041
- I owe you 100, right?
- Me?.. No!

1075
01:26:57,492 --> 01:26:58,845
Where are you?

1076
01:26:59,692 --> 01:27:01,203
In a restaurant

1077
01:27:01,412 --> 01:27:04,210
- And?
- And nothing...

1078
01:27:05,131 --> 01:27:08,122
Nothing special...
I just wanted to talk to you

1079
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:11,404
Anything wrong?

1080
01:27:11,612 --> 01:27:14,649
It's just that...
I'm with someone

1081
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:16,609
Mademoiselle Butterfly?

1082
01:27:17,051 --> 01:27:18,121
Right...

1083
01:27:19,252 --> 01:27:22,130
I can't take it!
She never talks...

1084
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,649
she just keeps smiling!

1085
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:26,729
She expects me to amuse her...

1086
01:27:27,011 --> 01:27:28,524
to tell her jokes...

1087
01:27:29,612 --> 01:27:30,725
I've had it!

1088
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:32,524
Tonight, I'm not even trying...

1089
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:33,608
Don't be mean

1090
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:37,444
It was good talking to you

1091
01:28:01,332 --> 01:28:03,082
Did you make your call?

1092
01:28:03,652 --> 01:28:05,801
You should have started

1093
01:28:11,332 --> 01:28:13,082
- Finished?
- What's next?

1094
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:15,408
- Some cheese?
- No thanks...

1095
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:17,238
Sorry!

1096
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:18,921
Cheese...

1097
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:23,364
I have another call to make

1098
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:25,127
Excuse me

1099
01:28:43,412 --> 01:28:44,322
It's me again

1100
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:46,122
Still eating?

1101
01:28:46,492 --> 01:28:49,404
Yes.
It's deadly... as I expected

1102
01:28:49,612 --> 01:28:50,600
Is the food good?

1103
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:52,962
Rumpsteak?.. In silence!

1104
01:28:53,171 --> 01:28:54,604
Each minute counts triple

1105
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,846
Feels like I've been here all day!

1106
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:58,399
Try to talk to her

1107
01:28:58,612 --> 01:28:59,930
I'm too bored to try!

1108
01:29:00,131 --> 01:29:01,609
I just want to beat it!..

1109
01:29:02,612 --> 01:29:04,841
And she's ordering cheese!

1110
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:09,560
But if she orders dessert...
I'll kill myself!

1111
01:29:26,212 --> 01:29:27,645
Cheese?

1112
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:31,087
That one's very good

1113
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,532
Excuse me...
another phone call...

1114
01:29:56,051 --> 01:29:57,121
Our coffee?

1115
01:29:57,332 --> 01:29:58,447
Not yet. After dessert...

1116
01:29:58,652 --> 01:30:01,006
Bring the check with the coffee

1117
01:30:02,692 --> 01:30:04,091
At the same time!

1118
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:09,805
It's me again

1119
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:12,127
She just doesn't understand!

1120
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:14,640
Now it's a souffle... 20 minutes!

1121
01:30:16,171 --> 01:30:17,127
Are you there?

1122
01:30:17,332 --> 01:30:18,287
I'm here...

1123
01:30:19,612 --> 01:30:20,203
Say something

1124
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:22,404
I'm listening

1125
01:30:23,452 --> 01:30:24,770
You know...

1126
01:30:25,091 --> 01:30:26,319
I'm listening

1127
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:32,279
I can't say it now...

1128
01:30:34,332 --> 01:30:35,685
I'd like to kiss you

1129
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:36,768
Me too...

1130
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:39,765
Tenderly

1131
01:30:40,011 --> 01:30:41,001
Me too...

1132
01:30:42,171 --> 01:30:42,921
Is that true?

1133
01:30:43,131 --> 01:30:44,087
It's true

1134
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:16,444
DROP DEAD!

1135
01:31:21,692 --> 01:31:24,841
ONE YEAR LATER...

1136
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,569
Say "Papi"...

1137
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:42,163
Go back inside

1138
01:31:44,011 --> 01:31:45,127
I'm coming!

1139
01:32:15,051 --> 01:32:16,724
I'm very late...

1140
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,367
Thank you...

1141
01:32:27,572 --> 01:32:30,404
Now they're really in love!

1142
01:32:32,504 --> 01:35:59,094

17
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:09,661
Hello.

18
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,660
- Get out! Hurry!
- What? Who is that?

19
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:14,175
Get moving! For god's
sake, get out of there!

20
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,695
Hello?

21
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:53,912
Montag, here.

22
00:06:57,393 --> 00:07:01,910
Well... What sort
were these then, Montag?

23
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:05,670
I didn't really look, sir.
A little bit of everything.

24
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:08,909
- Novels, biographies, adventure stories.
- Oh, routine, eh?

25
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,429
Why will they do it?
It's sheer perversity.

26
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:15,388
By the way...

27
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:18,907
What does Montag do
with his day off duty?

28
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:21,427
Not very much, sir.
Mow the lawn.

29
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,906
And what if the law
forbids that?

30
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:25,906
Just watch it grow, sir.

31
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:28,904
Uh-huh.
Good.

32
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:33,424
Good. Montag might be hearing
some exciting news in a day or two.

33
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:36,383
Benedict won't be with us
very much longer,

34
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:40,383
- And Montag's name has been mentioned.
- Promotion, sir?

35
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:43,942
I trust that the thought
makes Montag happy.

36
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,529
I think we're neighbours.
I live near block 813.

37
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,489
Isn't that where you live? Yes, I do.

38
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,527
Do you know we make the same
trip together almost every day?

39
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,492
Do we?
Hmm.

40
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,493
That's why
I thought to myself,

41
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,526
Well, we ought
to talk to each other.

42
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:57,526
Do you mind?
Me talking, I mean.

43
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:00,004
No, no, go ahead.
Talk.

44
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,524
I can't promise to think of
anything to answer though.

45
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:05,009
Don't worry about that.

46
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,008
Once I get started,
nothing can stop me.

47
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:10,487
My uncle says I am
a veritable well of words.

48
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:14,042
Has this uncle of yours ever warned
you never to speak to strangers?

49
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:17,561
No. He did say once if
anyone asked how old I was...

50
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:20,560
To say I was 20 years old
and light in the head.

51
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,559
- They always go together.
- "Light in the head"?

52
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:27,519
Mmm.
Loopy. Crazy.

53
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:30,799
Anyway,
you don't frighten me.

54
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,037
- Why should I?
- No reason really.

55
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:37,037
The uniform, I suppose.

56
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,516
Most people are...
Frightened,

57
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:42,075
- frightened of firemen.
- This is my stop now.

58
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,555
Mine too.

59
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:48,034
- Are you an officer?
- Oh, no. Not yet.

60
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:52,034
An officer has to...
I'm going to be promoted soon.

61
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:55,072
Even with my eyes closed, I
could tell what you do for a job.

62
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:58,592
- Because of the smell of kerosene?
- Huh.

63
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,071
Quite a scent,
isn't it?

64
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:05,591
My wife doesn't like it very
much. She says it lingers.

65
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,589
I don't mind. I think
of it as a... Perfume.

66
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,589
- Perfume?
- Yes, a perfume, like any other.

67
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:19,348
I don't think I've seen
your wife. What's she like?

68
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:22,586
She's rather like you,
except her hair is long.

69
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:25,586
- Rather like me?
- Quite like you.

70
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:31,585
Tell me, that number
you all wear, what's it mean?

71
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,064
Oh, Fahrenheit 451.

72
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:37,102
Why 451 rather than
813 or 121?

73
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:40,622
Fahrenheit 451 is the
temperature at which...

74
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:43,621
book paper catches fire
and starts to burn.

75
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:49,620
I'd like to ask you something
else, only I don't really dare.

76
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,140
Go ahead.

77
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,619
Is it true...

78
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,103
that a long time ago...

79
00:10:57,138 --> 00:11:02,097
firemen used to put out fires
and not burn books?

80
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:05,138
Really, your uncle is right.
You are light in the head.

81
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:07,101
"Put fires out"?
Who told you that?

82
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:11,136
- I don't know. Someone. But is it true?
- What a strange idea.

83
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,615
- Houses have always been fireproof.
- Ours isn't.

84
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:18,654
Well, then, it should be
condemned one of these days.

85
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:21,134
It has to be destroyed,
and you will have to move...

86
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:23,133
to a house that is fireproof.

87
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,613
Too bad.

88
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,132
Tell me,
why do you burn books?

89
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:30,616
What?

90
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,131
Well, it's a job
like any other.

91
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:35,610
Good work with lots
of variety.

92
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,890
Monday, we burn Miller; Tuesday,
Tolstoy; Wednesday, Walt Whitman;

93
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:44,169
Friday, Faulkner; and Saturday
and Sunday, Schopenhauer and Sartre.

94
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,647
"We burn them to ashes
and then burn the ashes."

95
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:50,166
That's our official motto.
You don't like books then?

96
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:54,166
- Do you like the rain?
- Yes, I adore it.

97
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,686
Books are just
so much... rubbish.

98
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,130
They have no interest.

99
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:05,684
Then why do some people still read
them although it's so dangerous?

100
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,163
Precisely because
it is forbidden.

101
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,641
Why is it forbidden?

102
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:13,442
Because it makes
people unhappy.

103
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,200
Do you really
believe that?

104
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,921
Oh, yes. Books
disturb people.

105
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,680
They make them
antisocial.

106
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,199
Do you think
I'm antisocial?

107
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,643
Why do you ask?

108
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:32,158
Well...
I'm a teacher.

109
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:35,956
Well, not quite.
I'm still on probation.

110
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:39,596
This afternoon
the analyst called me in,

111
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:43,394
And I don't think
I said the right things.

112
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,154
I'm not at all happy
about my answers.

113
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:50,713
That's probably why I've been so
rude to you. Have I been annoying you?

114
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:52,679
Oh, no,
not at all.

115
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:56,712
In fact, I was questioned
this afternoon as well.

116
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:59,191
I didn't do
too well either.

117
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:03,190
This is where I live.

118
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:06,710
You see?
This is my house.

119
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,209
- One more question.
- Another one?

120
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:14,708
- Just a tiny one.
- What is it?

121
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:17,708
Do you ever read
the books you burn?

122
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,707
Why should I? First,
I'm not interested.

123
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:23,226
Second, I've better things
to do. Third, it is forbidden.

124
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:25,745
Of course.

125
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,984
- You happy?
- What?

126
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,743
Of course I'm happy.

127
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,297
...so you can protect
yourself on the streets.

128
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:05,856
The art of self-defence,
and of attack on occasions,

129
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:08,855
may also come in handy
in the home, cousins.

130
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,341
If you watch carefully,
you will see...

131
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:15,374
how a woman can use a man's
superior weight to her own advantage.

132
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,819
Did you see that?

133
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,853
Now let's watch that
once again normally.

134
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:26,852
And now
in slow motion.

135
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:29,851
Watch it carefully
again, cousins.

136
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:33,131
I'm going to be promoted.

137
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,369
Are you listening, Linda?

138
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,888
Oh, that's marvellous,
Montag.

139
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:48,367
The captain told me
while we were out on a call.

140
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:50,851
What did you say?

141
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:54,366
I'm talking
about my promotion.

142
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:57,125
Does that mean
an increase, dear?

143
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,844
- How much?
- He didn't mention that.

144
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:02,403
We could move to a larger
house. Would you like that?

145
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:05,364
I'd rather have
a second wall-set put in.

146
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:08,363
They say when you have
your second wall-screen,

147
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:11,883
It's like having
your family grow around you.

148
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:14,401
Linda, how many of these pills
have you taken today?

149
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:18,361
What's that?

150
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,360
Oh, those. Help yourself.
I've got another bottle.

151
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,919
- How many have you had?
- Oh, don't carry on like that. Only a few.

152
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,878
Anyway,
tonight's special for me.

153
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:32,878
I've got a part in the family.

154
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,917
What?

155
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,436
Today's figures for operations
in the urban area alone...

156
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:43,694
Account for the elimination
of the total...

157
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,880
Of 2,750 pounds
of conventional editions.

158
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,434
Eight hundred and thirty-six
pounds of first editions...

159
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:53,392
And 17 pounds of manuscripts
were also destroyed.

160
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:57,952
Twenty-three antisocial elements
were detained, pending re-education.

161
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,432
Did you see that? Cousin
Claudette's got a bouffant tonight.

162
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,395
- Who?
- Cousin Claudette.

163
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:06,430
- Who is cousin Claudette?
- The cousin announcer. The one you don't like.

164
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,914
I don't like
any of them.

165
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:11,909
Why don't you get the
kitchen fixed? You are awful.

166
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:16,467
Oh, hurry, hurry!
I'll be on in a minute!

167
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,947
Quickly!
Quickly!

168
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:26,190
I don't understand.
How can you be in a play?

169
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:29,944
They've written a play with
one part missing. That's me.

170
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:32,944
When the people look at me,
then I have to speak.

171
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:35,983
They ask me a question,
and I have to say what I think.

172
00:16:37,982 --> 00:16:41,982
- The play, it's beginning.
- And now, for cousins everywhere,

173
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,981
our family theatre.

174
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:49,426
"Come play with us."

175
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,980
Naturally, in what
you are about to see...

176
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,499
any similarity with the truth or with
real life will be purely coincidental.

177
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:58,464
Do bear that in mind.

178
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,937
So, will you
come play with us?

179
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:06,457
You will? Good!
I thought you would.

180
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:09,940
Come in, cousins.
Be one of the family.

181
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:13,455
Charles, do you realize
what a dilemma this is?

182
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:16,014
It's terribly difficult.
I don't see any way out of it.

183
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:18,013
Come, come, Bernard. Of
course there's a way out.

184
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,459
There are 13 of us
so far, right?

185
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:22,973
You want to invite
Edward, which makes 14.

186
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:25,492
But if somebody's ill, then
we should be back to 13 again.

187
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,491
Precisely. Then we must invite
more people. That's an idea.

188
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:32,291
What about Lottie and
James? That'll make 16.

189
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:35,010
Then if somebody's ill,
at least we won't be 13.

190
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,529
But then there's
the problem of the rooms.

191
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:40,468
Lottie has 2 children,
2 little boys,

192
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:41,969
Freddie and little John.

193
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:43,973
I don't see any problem
there at all.

194
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:47,007
We can put the two
children in Helen's room.

195
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:50,526
What do you think, Linda?

196
00:17:56,046 --> 00:18:00,045
- Go ahead. They're waiting for you.
- I think that...

197
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,009
You see?
Linda agrees with me.

198
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:05,524
Lottie's children must go in with Helen's
children. Linda's absolutely right.

199
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:08,262
Then there's the problem
of the seating, Charles.

200
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:11,029
I think I've got something
worked out, though. Look.

201
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:13,762
If we put Yvonne at the head
and Richard at her right...

202
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,560
Oh, no, Bernard. Richard
isn't even speaking to Yvonne.

203
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,525
Oh?
Because of Leslie.

204
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,039
Oh! Madeleine must be at the head.

205
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,038
Besides, Madeleine is older than Yvonne.
She might even be older than Jacqueline.

206
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,558
I see no problem there. We put
Madeleine at the head of the table.

207
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:31,317
It's Madeleine,
isn't it, Linda?

208
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:34,037
Absolutely.

209
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:37,556
If Linda thinks
it's all right, it must be.

210
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,516
There's still the problem about
the rooms. What rooms are left?

211
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:44,075
There's the pink room. We could
always put Lillian in the pink room.

212
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:46,039
We can put Susan in the green room. Yes.

213
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:51,073
Where can we put Monica? Yes,
what can we do with Monica?

214
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:54,552
Do you have
the answer, Linda?

215
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:58,071
In the blue room?

216
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:00,592
Linda, you're right.

217
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,556
She's right.

218
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:07,070
Linda, you're
absolutely fantastic.

219
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:13,069
You saw it, didn't you?
I gave all the right answers.

220
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:16,588
Wasn't it wonderful? I could have
been an actress. Don't you think so?

221
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:20,107
- Think what?
- That I could have been an actress.

222
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:22,546
Oh, sure you could have
been an actress.

223
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:25,105
I wonder whether Joyce
was watching. I do hope so.

224
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:28,105
I must ring her tomorrow
and find out what she thought.

225
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,624
- How did you get the part?
- The head of the family rang me up. Me!

226
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:35,064
And said I was to be
in tonight's play.

227
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:40,102
Linda, they must have phoned every one
of 200,000 Lindas in the whole country.

228
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,622
That's not true.

229
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:48,100
I mean, even if it were true, you didn't
have to tell me. That was very mean.

230
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:52,846
So you're in for promotion,
Montag. Good luck.

231
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,325
Thank you.

232
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,844
Well, well, what's all this
we hear, Montag? Promotion, eh?

233
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:05,322
It seems so.

234
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:16,320
How do you feel
about it? Happy?

235
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,360
The wife rather likes
the idea. I suppose.

236
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:21,840
Hurry!

237
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,355
Attention!

238
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:51,872
That will do for today.
Go back to your desks.

239
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:04,390
What's this? I told you two I did not
want to see you sitting next to each other.

240
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:08,389
Didn't I make it clear enough
the first time? Yes, you!

241
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:10,909
You know what I mean.
Come and sit here.

242
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,385
Let us review
yesterday's lesson.

243
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:29,905
We studied how to detect books hidden
during the actual construction of a house.

244
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:32,423
This is somewhat rare
because it's very costly;

245
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,389
For its floors,
for its ceilings.

246
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:37,383
We also studied concealment
inside furniture.

247
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:43,421
Trainee firemen Stoneman and Black are
to report to captain's office immediately.

248
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,940
I repeat, trainee firemen
Stoneman and Black...

249
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:48,420
Are to report to the
captain's office immediately.

250
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:55,379
We were discussing
concealment inside furniture.

251
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:59,938
The most prevalent form being the
false icebox or the fake television set.

252
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:04,457
What occasionally presents problems
are books hidden in small quantities...

253
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:06,937
In everyday objects.

254
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:13,455
When one is looking for a book, the
most common area is to look for it...

255
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:16,934
in a rectangular object, like
a cigar box or a chocolate box...

256
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:18,898
or any other object
in similar shape.

257
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:22,453
I demonstrate how even a
cylindrical object can be used.

258
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:33,451
Montag will report
to the captain's office.

259
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,969
Here, you.
Hand me a pile of books.

260
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,929
While I'm gone, give each
of the trainees a book.

261
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:44,448
Each of you will hide his book
somewhere in this classroom.

262
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:47,967
When I return, I will give you
a demonstration how to search.

263
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:51,486
To learn how to find,
one must first know how to hide.

264
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:04,224
- What shall I say?
- We met by accident.

265
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:06,483
- That's no good.
- What do you want to say?

266
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:09,003
- We planned it?
- It was your idea.

267
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,446
- You're the one who thought of it.
- Shut up!

268
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:14,002
If we don't tell him the
same story, we're... Listen...

269
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:17,480
Let's play this by ear.

270
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,999
- Montag, this will take about five minutes.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,517
What time is it?

272
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:31,997
Uh... 10:00, sir.

273
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:59,031
Get out! This is
the last time!

274
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:03,030
Get out!

275
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,546
- Like gymnastics, Montag?
- Yes, sir.

276
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:23,026
- And what about hockey? Do you like hockey?
- Yes, I do, sir.

277
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:26,064
- And golf?
- Golf. Very much, sir.

278
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:29,064
- Hmm? And football?
- Wonderful, sir.

279
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,024
Billiards?
Basketball?

280
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,503
Oh, they're all
very fine sports, sir.

281
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:38,542
Then increase the dosage.
More sports for everyone, hmm?

282
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:44,021
Strengthen the group spirit.
Organize the fun. Hmm?

283
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:48,060
Just keep them busy, and you keep
them happy. That's what matters.

284
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:51,059
Hmm?
Am I right?

285
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,059
Absolutely, sir.

286
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:03,577
Well, shall we talk a little
about this promotion of yours?

287
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:07,576
You have mentioned
the possibility to your wife?

288
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:11,055
- Yes, sir.
- And her reaction?

289
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:15,574
She thought we might be able
to have a second wall-screen.

290
00:26:15,614 --> 00:26:20,538
Oh, you only have
the one wall converted. I see.

291
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:24,092
These matters of promotion are much more
important to a married man, aren't they?

292
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:26,611
I guess so, sir.

293
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,091
Montag... You have
no children, I believe.

294
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,569
No, sir.
We have no children.

295
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,574
Well, then, a commission
seems in order.

296
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:42,089
I can't see any reason offhand
why it shouldn't go through.

297
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:44,053
You understand, of course,

298
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:48,607
With the new amendment to the law, we
must expect to be worked really very hard.

299
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,571
Very hard, indeed,

300
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:53,606
Until we can arrange for
new volunteers to be drafted.

301
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,605
Yes, sir, I heard the men
talking about it.

302
00:26:56,645 --> 00:27:00,084
How long have you been with us?

303
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:04,084
For six years, sir.
Yes, for six years.

304
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,883
No, no, no, for five
years, sir. For five years.

305
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:11,642
Montag has one quality
I appreciate greatly.

306
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:14,121
He says very little.

307
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:18,120
Have you seen
my personal medallion?

308
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,600
It's a remarkable likeness.

309
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,119
You must remind me to let you
have one sometime.

310
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:26,638
Now, let's get back
to this promotion of yours.

311
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:29,158
I've been looking
through your file.

312
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:32,637
There are only six back views.
We need 12 of them, you know.

313
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:35,122
Two sets of six.

314
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:37,636
Remember that, Montag.

315
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,670
Linda?

316
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:08,190
Linda!

317
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:45,666
Hospital listening.

318
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,700
- Yes, it's about my wife. She...
- Name and address.

319
00:28:48,741 --> 00:28:52,219
Uh... Montag.
Block 813.

320
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:55,698
- 813?
- Uh, just a moment.

321
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:06,700
Hello? I just came home from work, yes.

322
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:09,736
- And I found her on the floor unconscious.
- Does she take pills?

323
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,972
- Of course! Yesterday, she...
- Just a moment.

324
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,175
- I'll connect you with poisoning section.
- Yes.

325
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:17,214
- Poisoning listening.
- It's about my wife. She...

326
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:20,692
- Name and address.
- Uh, Montag. Block 813.

327
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:24,732
- What kind of pills?
- Oh... Uh, just a moment.

328
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:31,690
- Hello?
- Yes?

329
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:35,250
- They are red.
- Oh, and red number two.

330
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,694
Oh, it's a stimulant.
It's harmless.

331
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:41,248
She's probably taken the wrong
kind of sedative on top of that.

332
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,728
Oh, just a moment.

333
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,726
- Hello?
- Yes, listening.

334
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:55,206
Oh, yes, they are
golden number eight.

335
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:58,244
Right. Stay close to her.
The ambulance is on its way.

336
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:02,764
- Four minutes.
- What should I do in the meantime?

337
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,242
Nothing.

338
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,686
Where is the doctor?

339
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:16,201
What doctor? The doctor
that took care of my wife.

340
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,999
No doctors on these jobs. We do
all the blood jobs, me and him.

341
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,759
- No, it's here, please.
- That's right, us. Who did you expect?

342
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:26,198
Cases like that... We
handle 50 a day like her.

343
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:29,718
That's right. She won't be the last
tonight, not by a long shot. No, sir.

344
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:34,757
Don't you worry, sir. We'll give her a
pump out and fill her up with new blood.

345
00:30:34,796 --> 00:30:37,756
In 20 minutes, she'll be as
good as new. Just you relax.

346
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,719
This isn't pretty
to look at.

347
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,715
You need a strong stomach.
You better wait out there.

348
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:47,754
You just leave it all to us. We'll
call you as soon as she's done.

349
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:50,753
This regulator is not
as regular as it was.

350
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:55,752
Come here
with that thing.

351
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:59,271
First,
get the stockings off.

352
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:06,269
Never mind that.
Put the dress on that chair.

353
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:18,267
All right, sir,
you can come in now.

354
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:27,265
She's fresh as a daisy,
good as gold.

355
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:29,784
- She's still unconscious.
- I wouldn't say that, sir.

356
00:31:29,825 --> 00:31:32,503
You've got it wrong.
She's asleep.

357
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:35,183
Never mind about her.
You get to bed.

358
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:37,522
By tomorrow,
it'll all be forgotten.

359
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:39,786
She'll be completely well
by tomorrow?

360
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:42,822
Better than that. Take my word for
it, she'll be on top of the world.

361
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:45,821
She'll have an appetite
for all sorts of things.

362
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,300
That's right. She'll be
starving. You'll find out.

363
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,813
My, I'm hungry.

364
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:22,298
How do you feel?

365
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:24,297
Hungry.
Really hungry.

366
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:27,330
- I'm absolutely starving. I could eat a horse.
- Do you remember last night?

367
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,811
- Yes, what a sleep. I slept like a log.
- Listen...

368
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:32,330
- When I came home last night, you were...
- I'm absolutely famished.

369
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,330
Let me talk, Linda,
will you?

370
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:37,809
Oh...
Of course, darling.

371
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:41,369
Talk all you like
if it makes you happy.

372
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,848
Go on then.
What about last night?

373
00:32:43,887 --> 00:32:46,607
Nothing.
I can't remember.

374
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:49,367
It doesn't matter anyway.

375
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,810
Look.

376
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,365
I've bought you a present
to celebrate your...

377
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:59,125
Oh, I forget what.
Never mind.

378
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,844
Do you like it?
Isn't it lovely?

379
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:04,363
Do you like it? Yes, I do. Very much.

380
00:33:04,403 --> 00:33:06,882
Isn't it smart?
It's the very latest.

381
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:09,322
Everyone's
using them now.

382
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,881
Can I throw
your old one away?

383
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,877
Linda.

384
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:30,397
Linda.

385
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,394
I've something
to tell you.

386
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:44,394
Are you listening,
Linda?

387
00:33:47,913 --> 00:33:50,393
What are you doing?

388
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:56,912
Linda?

389
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,911
Hey!

390
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,698
Do you ever read
the books you burn?

391
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:00,661
Hey, you, come here.
Come here.

392
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:05,217
Here. What's all this?
What is it? Eh?

393
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,660
Hey!

394
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:10,735
Come on. Come on. Come on.

395
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:15,174
All right.
Hold him.

396
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:17,694
But some boys still boycott
the barbershops.

397
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:22,213
Here you see a mop-up squad at work
on one of these messy know-it-alls.

398
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:26,212
It all goes to show
law enforcement can be fun.

399
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,244
How come the door
is not working?

400
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,760
You're just in time.
Dinner is nearly ready.

401
00:36:45,794 --> 00:36:48,794
Montag, what are you doing? I'm coming.

Ah-ah.

- Oh! Everything all right?
- Yes, everything's all right.

That's what they always say,
so it must be... All right.

428
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:49,672
It certainly doesn't look
that way. What's wrong?

00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:51,638
Oh, everything.

too long to...

somewhere quiet then.

433

- Won't you be late?
- No, I have plenty of time. Let's go over here.

434
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:32,183
I saw you the other day, when
we were going out on a call.

435
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,662
I was
on the fire engine.

436
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:38,702
You know, it's funny.
It reminded me of something.

437
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:41,701
A girl who used to wait...

438
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:43,961
For a soldier...

439
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,180
By a barrack gate.

440
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,700
- What's happened?
- You remember the analyst, how worried I was?

441
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:56,217
I was right to be worried.
I've been dismissed.

442
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,698
Why? What reason
did they give?

443
00:43:59,217 --> 00:44:02,696
None at all.
Just an official call.

444
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:05,661
Services no longer required.

445
00:44:05,696 --> 00:44:08,180
I'm never to go
to the school anymore.

446
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:11,735
They must give you a reason. Make them
tell you why. Go to the school and ask.

447
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,698
I can't do that.

448
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,213
Anyway, who knows what they may
have said about me to the children.

449
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:23,211
Strange. I wonder what you
said that made the analyst...

450
00:44:23,732 --> 00:44:26,691
Don't you have any idea?
Something you said or did?

451
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:31,251
I never did get on well with
the staff. They disapprove of me.

452
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,689
I don't always stick
to the timetable and...

453
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:37,249
We have fun in my classes,
and they don't like that.

454
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:41,692
There was another teacher,
the one I replaced.

455
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:46,206
The same thing happened to her.
They didn't like her either.

456
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:50,766
- Now she's in some awful kind of trouble.
- Then it wasn't the analyst.

457
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:55,245
It was the staff that wanted to get
rid of you because you are different.

458
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:59,724
Look at that fellow
over there.

459
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:03,243
What's he doing? That's
the information box.

460
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:07,722
- He can't make up his mind.
- What's he want to find out?

461
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:10,281
He doesn't want to find out anything.
He knows someone who has books.

462
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:13,281
So he got hold of that
person's picture and number,

463
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,725
And is going to drop it
into that box.

464
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:19,279
- But he's an informer!
- No, he's an informant. Look at him.

465
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,278
Like someone circling
around a woman.

466
00:45:26,798 --> 00:45:29,797
He's putting something in
his mouth. It's a stimulant...

467
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:32,761
To work up his nerve.

468
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:34,796
He wants to make sure
no one can see him.

469
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,236
Look at him.

470
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,240
He's walking away.

471
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:41,914
You see? He couldn't
go through with it.

472
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,554
Don't worry, he'll be back.
Here he comes.

473
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:47,793
Good lord,
make up your mind.

474
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,552
- There. What a relief.
- Now he's got rid of his noisy neighbour...

475
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:54,792
or his brother-in-law who has got
a better job or even his mother.

476
00:45:55,311 --> 00:45:57,751
Why not?
It's time to work.

477
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:01,309
Please, go back to the
school and try to find out.

478
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,754
No, I can't do that.

479
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:06,269
You must find an excuse
to go back there.

480
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:10,307
I suppose I ought to go
and clear out my locker.

481
00:46:10,828 --> 00:46:14,307
That's all right. Uh, I
have to hurry. Good luck.

482
00:46:14,347 --> 00:46:17,587
I'm not going.
You must come with me.

483
00:46:17,627 --> 00:46:20,826
But I can't.
I have to go to work.

484
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:23,104
I'll take care of that.

485
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,345
Come on.
Leave it to me.

486
00:46:33,823 --> 00:46:36,342
The Rodier firehouse.

487
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,820
Extension one, miss.

488
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:54,823
Rodier firehouse listening.

489
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:58,338
- Can I speak to...
- Who's calling?

490
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:03,855
- I'm speaking for Montag.
- Yes?

491
00:47:04,337 --> 00:47:08,854
- Can I speak to the captain?
- One moment.

492
00:47:11,854 --> 00:47:15,813
- Captain listening.
- This is Linda Montag.

493
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,338
- Montag's wife?
- Yes.

494
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:20,372
- What can I do for you?
- My husband asked me to tell you...

495
00:47:20,408 --> 00:47:23,332
He's been taken ill
and can't leave his bed.

496
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:26,891
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- No, he should be up by this evening.

497
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:29,890
- Very well, madam. Thank you for informing me.
- Thank you.

498
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:38,889
Montag's wife. He's not too
well. He's staying in bed.

499
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:40,908
Montag?

500
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,852
Mmm.

501
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:46,887
Is he?
I see.

502
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,405
Well, Fabian,
that'll do for now.

503
00:47:50,886 --> 00:47:53,405
Until the meeting.

504
00:48:00,884 --> 00:48:03,402
Okay.

505
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:12,401
Nine thirteens are
a hundred and seventeen.

506
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:17,399
Nine fourteens are
a hundred and twenty-six.

507
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,398
Nine fifteens are
a hundred and thirty-five.

508
00:48:22,439 --> 00:48:26,918
Nine sixteens are
a hundred and forty-four.

509
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:31,877
Nine seventeens are
a hundred and fifty-three.

510
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:35,915
That's Robert. Nine eighteens
are a hundred and sixty-two.

511
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:40,914
Nine nineteens are
a hundred and seventy-one.

512
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:48,433
Robert.

513
00:48:51,952 --> 00:48:55,391
Nine thirteens are
a hundred and seventeen.

514
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:58,431
- It may be my uniform.
- Yes, yes, that's what frightened him!

515
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:01,230
- It must have been your uniform.
- Go ahead. I'll wait here.

516
00:49:01,264 --> 00:49:03,909
All right.

517
00:49:03,948 --> 00:49:07,908
Nine sixteens are
a hundred and forty-four.

518
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:12,428
Nine seventeens are
a hundred and fifty-three.

519
00:49:12,468 --> 00:49:15,946
Nine eighteens are
a hundred and sixty-three.

520
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:57,457
One twelve is twelve.
Two twelves is twenty-four.

521
00:49:57,496 --> 00:50:02,496
Three twelves is thirty-six.
Four twelves is forty-eight.

522
00:50:02,536 --> 00:50:04,941
Five twelves is sixty.

523
00:50:04,976 --> 00:50:10,014
Six twelves is seventy-two.
Seven twelves is eighty-four.

524
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,454
Eight twelves
is ninety-six.

525
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:15,493
Nine twelves
is a hundred and eight.

526
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:18,453
Ten twelves
is a hundred and twenty.

527
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:22,491
Eleven twelves
is a hundred and thirty-two.

528
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:25,012
Twelve twelves...

529
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,009
I'm going
to be promoted.

530
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:32,974
They'll listen
to me then.

531
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:37,008
I'll go and see your
principal myself. Come.

532
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:42,487
- Why?
- What?

533
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:45,527
How did it come about?

534
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:50,485
What made it begin?

535
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:53,525
What made you want to do...

536
00:50:56,524 --> 00:51:02,042
How could someone like you
be doing this kind of work?

537
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:06,042
I know everyone says that.
But you!

538
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:08,522
You're not like them.

539
00:51:08,561 --> 00:51:12,041
When I say something to you,
you look at me.

540
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:16,039
Why did you
choose this job?

541
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,999
For you it doesn't seem
to make any sense.

542
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,037
Do you remember what
you asked me the other day?

543
00:51:24,073 --> 00:51:28,557
If I ever read the books
I burn? Remember?

544
00:51:28,597 --> 00:51:31,356
Last night I read one.

545
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:08,389
"Because I'd be ashamed
of myself."

546
00:52:14,906 --> 00:52:19,386
Ashamed of myself.

547
00:52:21,386 --> 00:52:26,385
"It was a little
after half past 11:00."

548
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:48,939
- What are you doing, Linda?
- I found these things in the house.

549
00:52:48,974 --> 00:52:51,899
I don't want these things.
They frighten me.

550
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:55,938
You spend your whole life in
front of that "family" on the wall.

551
00:52:55,977 --> 00:52:58,417
These books
are my family.

552
00:53:02,936 --> 00:53:06,416
When did we first meet?
And where?

553
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:09,454
What? When did we meet
for the first time?

554
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,971
I don't know.

555
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:14,453
Let me think.

556
00:53:16,453 --> 00:53:18,417
No, I really
can't remember.

557
00:53:18,452 --> 00:53:22,451
Oh, that's rather sad.
Don't you think? I do.

558
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:25,932
I think it's very sad.

559
00:53:25,971 --> 00:53:28,931
Behind each of these
books, there's a man.

560
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,970
That's what interests me. So leave
them alone and go back to bed.

561
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:37,968
I can't sleep. You have
your pills, haven't you?

562
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,412
"Rhinoceros:

563
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:47,446
"any of certain large, powerful,

564
00:53:47,487 --> 00:53:53,485
"thick-skinned
perissodactyl mammals...

565
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:56,004
"of the family...

566
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:58,484
Rhinocerotidae."

567
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,440
- Well, look who's here.
- What about it?

568
00:54:13,481 --> 00:54:15,960
- I thought you were on sick leave.
- Sick leave?

569
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:19,480
- Who gave you that idea?
- I don't remember. I must have got it wrong.

570
00:55:05,709 --> 00:55:08,228
Hurry up.

571
00:55:14,747 --> 00:55:17,746
Montag, you've
forgotten your helmet.

572
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:36,262
What's this, Montag? Something
wrong between you and the pole?

573
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:48,744
Oh, mummy, look!

574
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:52,778
Firemen. Mummy, there's
going to be a fire.

575
00:57:04,802 --> 00:57:08,281
"Play the man,
master Ridley.

576
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:12,320
"We shall this day light such
a candle, by god's grace...

577
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,759
As I trust shall
never be put out."

578
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,763
The police haven't done their
job very well. Who is this woman?

579
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,318
What is she doing here? Well, she's
certainly worth looking at anyway.

580
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:25,338
Police arrested the family this
morning, sir. She must have been out.

581
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:28,317
Where are the books? If you didn't
know that, you wouldn't be here.

582
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:31,836
Upstairs. Montag,
you stay here.

583
00:57:37,314 --> 00:57:42,313
Hey! You two, in there!

584
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:46,354
In there.
Go on.

585
00:57:51,352 --> 00:57:54,352
Down there!
Throw them all down!

586
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:59,350
Break it open! That's it.

587
00:58:04,868 --> 00:58:06,834
This way! Come on!

588
00:58:06,868 --> 00:58:09,348
Down there!
Throw them all down!

589
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:13,867
All the books! All of them!
This way! Come on!

590
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:39,861
"Once upon a time, there was a
poor woodcutter whose name was... "

591
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:43,660
They can't have my books.
They'll never take them away.

592
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,379
Montag, I think you
should see this. Yes, sir.

593
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:51,338
Come on! Quickly!

594
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:53,898
This is a real eyeful.

595
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:59,897
Ah, Montag.
I knew it. I knew it.

596
00:59:00,377 --> 00:59:03,896
Of course, all this...
The existence of a secret...

597
00:59:03,935 --> 00:59:06,855
Library was known
in high places,

598
00:59:06,896 --> 00:59:09,374
But there was no way
of getting at it.

599
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:12,893
Only once before have I seen
so many books in one place.

600
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:16,852
I was just an ordinary
fireman at the time.

601
00:59:16,893 --> 00:59:20,892
I wasn't even qualified
to use the flamethrower.

602
00:59:22,411 --> 00:59:24,930
It's all ours, Montag.

603
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,894
Listen to me, Montag.

604
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,369
Once to each fireman,
at least once in his career,

605
00:59:32,408 --> 00:59:34,929
He just itches to know what
these books are all about.

606
00:59:34,968 --> 00:59:38,373
He just aches to know.
Isn't that so?

607
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:42,447
Take my word for it, Montag,
there's nothing there.

608
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:44,926
The books have nothing
to say!

609
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:50,410
Look, these are all novels.

610
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:54,445
All about people
that never existed.

611
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,443
The people that read them, it makes
them unhappy with their own lives,

612
00:59:58,923 --> 01:00:02,443
Makes them want to live in other
ways that can never really be.

613
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:08,406
What's happening?

614
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:10,960
This house is condemned. They said to
burn the books here with everything else.

615
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:14,960
Burning the house is one thing.
Burning the books is another, isn't it?

616
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,919
It's never any good
burning everything together.

617
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:22,958
Come on, Montag. All this
philosophy, let's get rid of it.

618
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:25,441
It's even worse
than the novels.

619
01:00:25,477 --> 01:00:28,477
Thinkers, philosophers, all of
them saying exactly the same thing:

620
01:00:28,516 --> 01:00:32,475
"Only I am right.
The others are all idiots."

621
01:00:33,955 --> 01:00:38,474
One century, they tell you
man's destiny is predetermined.

622
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:42,434
The next, they say that
he has freedom of choice.

623
01:00:42,474 --> 01:00:44,952
It's just a matter of fashion,
that's all. Philosophy.

624
01:00:44,993 --> 01:00:50,232
Just like short dresses this
year, long dresses next year.

625
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:55,471
Look. All stories of the
dead. Biography that's called.

626
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:57,990
And autobiography.

627
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,509
My life. My diary.
My memoirs.

628
01:01:02,544 --> 01:01:04,948
My intimate memoirs.

629
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:09,947
Of course, when they started out,
it was just the urge to write.

630
01:01:09,988 --> 01:01:13,507
Then after the second or third book, all
they wanted was to satisfy their own vanity,

631
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:16,506
To stand out from the crowd,
to be different,

632
01:01:16,546 --> 01:01:20,505
To be able to look down
on all the others.

633
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:24,464
Ah, critic's prize.
This is a good one.

634
01:01:24,504 --> 01:01:30,023
Of course, he had the critics
on his side. Lucky fellow.

635
01:01:30,502 --> 01:01:32,982
Just tell me this, Montag,
at a guess,

636
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,501
How many literary awards were made in
this country, on an average each year?

637
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:42,466
Five, ten, forty? Hmm?
No less than 1,200.

638
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:47,499
Anybody that put pen to paper was
bound to win some prize someday.

639
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:52,538
Ah, Robinson Crusoe. The negroes didn't
like that because of his man, Friday.

640
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:58,016
And Nietzsche. Ah, Nietzsche.
The Jews didn't like Nietzsche.

641
01:01:58,537 --> 01:02:00,501
Now, here's a book
about lung cancer.

642
01:02:00,537 --> 01:02:05,055
All the cigarette smokers got into a panic,
so for everybody's peace of mind, we burn it.

643
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:12,533
Ah, now this one must be very
profound. The Ethics of Aristotle.

644
01:02:13,053 --> 01:02:17,533
Now anybody that read that must believe
he's a cut above anybody that hadn't.

645
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:21,332
You see, it's no good, Montag.
We've all got to be alike.

646
01:02:21,372 --> 01:02:25,050
The only way to be happy is
for everyone to be made equal.

647
01:02:25,091 --> 01:02:29,090
So, we must burn the books,
Montag.

648
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:33,048
- All the books.
- Sir.

649
01:02:33,568 --> 01:02:37,048
- Yes, what's the matter?
- Trouble with the old lady downstairs.

650
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:39,047
She won't leave. She won't
leave her books, she says.

651
01:02:39,082 --> 01:02:42,047
She won't leave her books,
won't she? Won't she?

652
01:02:47,526 --> 01:02:50,045
Come on now, Madam.
We're gonna burn the house.

653
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,489
No. What do you want? Martyrdom?

654
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:56,564
I want to die as I've lived. Oh,
you must have read that in there.

655
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:59,042
I'm not going to ask
you again. Are you going?

656
01:02:59,078 --> 01:03:03,042
These books were alive.
They spoke to me.

657
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,561
Go ahead.

658
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:26,623
All right, that's enough. Come
on, Madam, you've got ten seconds.

659
01:04:28,104 --> 01:04:30,623
Fabian, ten count.

660
01:04:30,663 --> 01:04:32,587
One.

661
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:37,101
Two. Three.

662
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:40,901
Four. Five.

663
01:04:40,941 --> 01:04:44,579
Six. Seven.

664
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,579
Eight.

665
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,878
- Nine.
- Nine elevens are ninety-nine.

666
01:04:50,914 --> 01:04:54,138
Nine twelves
are a hundred and eight.

667
01:04:54,618 --> 01:04:58,377
- Nine thirteens are a 117.
- She can't stay here.

668
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:02,136
- She refuses to leave.
- She must be forced to leave.

669
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,650
Back there! Open up!

670
01:06:02,203 --> 01:06:04,681
Everybody, outside!

671
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:11,200
Come on,
you too, Montag!

672
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:20,958
Montag!
Get out of there!

673
01:06:20,998 --> 01:06:25,197
Montag!
Come on, this way!

674
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:27,717
Montag!

675
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:31,196
Montag!

676
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:42,553
Finally, do remember to
tolerate your friends' friends,

677
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:46,033
However alien and peculiar
they may seem to you.

678
01:06:46,072 --> 01:06:49,072
- Don't despise minorities.
- Doesn't cousin Midge's face look swollen?

679
01:06:49,112 --> 01:06:52,031
- That's because she's pregnant.
- Is that why?

680
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:55,511
I think it's irresponsible
to have children.

681
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:58,549
Somebody's got to have children,
Jackie. They can't let the race die out.

682
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:02,829
Babies grow up to look
like you. That must be fun.

683
01:07:02,869 --> 01:07:07,068
- Strangle violence. Suppress prejudice.
- Here's Montag.

684
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,028
Be tolerant today.

685
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:14,026
Being just pretty
is not enough.

686
01:07:14,066 --> 01:07:17,586
The wife who uses translusives
knows better than that.

687
01:07:17,626 --> 01:07:21,064
Try some today, but watch out
for your friends' husbands.

688
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,585
They'll be around you
like flies.

689
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:43,620
No one will ever notice
that your chairs don't match,

690
01:07:43,655 --> 01:07:46,099
And you'll be
as popular as ever.

691
01:07:55,097 --> 01:07:57,062
Would you excuse me?

692
01:07:57,097 --> 01:08:00,095
Yes, I like her hair
like this.

693
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:11,093
Come on, Montag,
be good now.

694
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:16,613
Come on over and sit with us. You haven't
seen Jackie and Doris and Helen for ages.

695
01:08:17,133 --> 01:08:20,132
- It's very rude, you know.
- Leave me alone.

696
01:08:20,171 --> 01:08:23,576
Aren't you well?

697
01:08:23,611 --> 01:08:26,650
All right,
but it's very naughty.

698
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,608
...are being reclassified.

699
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:36,648
Two cells of antisocials
were located earlier today...

700
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:38,613
In the western
metropolitan area.

701
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:41,091
The police have declined
to comment so far.

702
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:44,606
Meanwhile, the "report those
who threaten you" campaign...

703
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:48,126
- met with particular success today...
- When an old woman, cousins,

704
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,644
chose to be burned with her books
rather than being separated from them.

705
01:08:51,685 --> 01:08:54,604
If that's a joke,
it's not in very good taste.

706
01:08:54,643 --> 01:08:58,163
- You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
- Don't be silly, Montag.

707
01:08:58,203 --> 01:09:00,127
Things like that
don't happen.

708
01:09:00,162 --> 01:09:02,608
You mean, you don't want
to hear about it. I saw it!

709
01:09:02,642 --> 01:09:06,681
- My husband says...
- Oh, your husband! You don't even know where he is!

710
01:09:06,716 --> 01:09:08,646
- Montag!
- Of course I know.

711
01:09:08,682 --> 01:09:12,160
- He's been called on reserve for some field training.
- Or to fight a little war.

712
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,159
You never know, do you?
Why do you call it that?

713
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:16,124
Even if he was,
what about it?

714
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,123
He's not allowed to call
me until it's all over.

715
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:20,918
- It'll only be about a week or two.
- He'll be all right.

716
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:23,637
The point about wars is, if
you want to call them that,

717
01:09:23,678 --> 01:09:26,677
it's only other women's husbands
who get killed. That's true.

718
01:09:26,716 --> 01:09:29,956
I never knew anyone
who got killed in a...

719
01:09:29,996 --> 01:09:33,155
Not anyone whose husband
died like that.

720
01:09:33,195 --> 01:09:36,195
Getting run over, jumping
out of a window, yes.

721
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:39,194
Like Gloria's husband
a few nights ago.

722
01:09:39,674 --> 01:09:42,159
But never
that other way.

723
01:09:42,193 --> 01:09:44,673
Anyway, that's life,
isn't it?

724
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,677
That's what you call it.

725
01:09:46,712 --> 01:09:49,672
You're nothing
but zombies, all of you.

726
01:09:49,712 --> 01:09:53,190
Just like those husbands of
yours you don't even know anymore.

727
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,231
You're not living,
you're just killing time!

728
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,729
Well, I think it's time to go. Yes, I...

729
01:09:58,765 --> 01:10:01,188
Thank you. It was a lovely afternoon.

730
01:10:01,224 --> 01:10:03,669
Really fun. Yes. Sit down!

731
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:06,708
- Come on, sit down. It'll only take a minute.
- Whatever is that?

732
01:10:06,747 --> 01:10:09,187
- Darling.
- It's not a book?

733
01:10:09,228 --> 01:10:11,671
That's what it is.
It's a novel.

734
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,671
Oh, it's a book! Oh, you
mustn't! It's against the law!

735
01:10:13,706 --> 01:10:18,185
- Quiet. Sit down and listen.
- Since Montag really insists.

736
01:10:18,226 --> 01:10:21,184
But when he's through,
I hope we can do as we please.

737
01:10:24,184 --> 01:10:26,703
"There can be no disparity
in marriage...

738
01:10:26,743 --> 01:10:29,143
"like unsuitability
of mind and purpose.

739
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:33,147
"I had endeavoured to adapt Dora to
myself and found it impracticable.

740
01:10:33,181 --> 01:10:37,701
"It remained for me to adapt myself to Dora,
to share with her what I could and be happy.

741
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:41,179
"It made my second year
much happier than my first,

742
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:44,699
"and, what was better still,
made Dora's life all sunshine.

743
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:48,178
"But as that year wore on,
Dora was not strong.

744
01:10:48,219 --> 01:10:52,698
"I had hoped that lighter hands than
mine would help to mould her character...

745
01:10:52,737 --> 01:10:57,217
"and that a baby's smile upon her breast
might change my child-wife to a woman.

746
01:10:57,257 --> 01:11:01,175
"It was not to be.
My pretty Dora.

747
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:04,216
"We thought she would be running
about as she used to do in a few days.

748
01:11:04,255 --> 01:11:07,214
"But they said wait a few days
more, and then wait a few days more,

749
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:10,179
"and still she neither
ran nor walked.

750
01:11:10,214 --> 01:11:14,213
"I began to carry her downstairs
every morning and upstairs every night.

751
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:18,252
"But sometimes when I took her up, I
felt that she was lighter in my arms.

752
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:20,216
"A dead, blank feeling
came upon me,

753
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:23,731
"as if I were approaching
some frozen region...

754
01:11:23,771 --> 01:11:27,690
"yet unseen
that numbed my life.

755
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:32,249
"I avoided direct recognition of this feeling
by any name, over any communing with myself.

756
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,528
"Until one night when it was
very strong upon me...

757
01:11:35,569 --> 01:11:38,768
"and my aunt had left her
with her parting cry,

758
01:11:38,802 --> 01:11:40,732
"'Oh, good-bye,
little blossom.'

759
01:11:40,767 --> 01:11:45,006
"I sat down at my desk,
alone, and tried to think.

760
01:11:45,046 --> 01:11:49,245
"oh, what a fatal name
it was.

761
01:11:49,285 --> 01:11:51,209
"and how the blossom...

762
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:56,244
withered in its bloom
up in the tree."

763
01:11:56,764 --> 01:12:00,763
I knew that's what would happen.
It's what I've always said.

764
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:04,762
Life isn't like novels, novels
and tears, novels and suicide.

765
01:12:04,802 --> 01:12:08,040
Novels are sick.
That was sheer cruelty, Montag.

766
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,280
You're a cruel man. All
those words; idiotic words.

767
01:12:11,321 --> 01:12:13,724
Evil words
that hurt people.

768
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,724
Isn't there enough
trouble as it is?

769
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,278
Why disturb people with that
sort of filth? Poor Doris.

770
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:21,238
Bye, Linda. We were
having such a nice party.

771
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:24,797
- Such a shame.
- I can't bear to know those feelings.

772
01:12:24,837 --> 01:12:27,796
I'd forgotten
all about those things.

773
01:12:27,836 --> 01:12:30,276
Oh, I'm sorry, Doris.

774
01:12:32,795 --> 01:12:35,274
They won't come back.
I'll be all alone.

775
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,274
I won't be popular anymore.

776
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:39,794
They won't use me
in the family anymore.

777
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:42,279
And you made Doris cry!

778
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:44,278
She cried because
it is true.

779
01:12:44,313 --> 01:12:47,312
What are you going to do now?
Haven't you done enough harm?

780
01:12:47,352 --> 01:12:50,572
Leave me alone, Linda. I've
got reading to do. Quite a lot.

781
01:12:50,607 --> 01:12:53,790
- What's the matter with you? Aren't you well?
- It's nothing.

782
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:56,790
I've got to read.

783
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:00,828
I've got to catch up with
the remembrance of the past!

784
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:18,439
Right. You four,
over to the house!

785
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:21,477
Take out the line.

786
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:27,996
- This is it. Hurry. Go on!
- But what about you, uncle?

787
01:15:28,475 --> 01:15:30,441
Don't worry.
Get going!

788
01:15:30,476 --> 01:15:33,955
All right.
Take your time. I'm coming.

789
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:36,474
Open up! Come on!
We know there's someone in there!

790
01:15:36,515 --> 01:15:39,473
Please, wait a minute.
I'm coming.

791
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:45,992
- Come on! Open up!
- All right! I'm coming!

792
01:15:46,032 --> 01:15:49,472
Come on, come on.

793
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:52,511
- Now, watch it.
- You watch it.

794
01:16:20,024 --> 01:16:22,984
- What is this?
- I'm moving this chair.

795
01:16:23,024 --> 01:16:25,504
I'm fed up with it
in the middle of the room.

796
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:28,542
And this one...
I'm going to put...

797
01:16:28,578 --> 01:16:31,503
Over here.

798
01:16:31,542 --> 01:16:34,261
There. And I'm going to
change those curtains.

799
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:36,986
I've never liked them.
I'm gonna get new ones.

800
01:16:37,021 --> 01:16:39,540
And I'm gonna change the
laundry basket. I've decided...

801
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,985
You're right. The chair's
much better over there.

802
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:47,018
You know, you're not well. You
were tossing and turning all night.

803
01:16:47,059 --> 01:16:49,819
You kept me awake.
You ought to stay home today.

804
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:52,498
No, no, I'm going to
the firehouse. I must.

805
01:16:52,537 --> 01:16:55,536
Because I don't know if I'm going
there tomorrow or any other day.

806
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:58,536
- But what about your promotion?
- My promotion?

807
01:16:58,576 --> 01:17:01,056
That was before.

808
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:03,535
Montag.

809
01:17:05,535 --> 01:17:10,054
Look, last night...
You were talking in your sleep.

810
01:17:10,094 --> 01:17:12,018
I don't know what.
I didn't understand.

811
01:17:12,054 --> 01:17:17,572
And I don't understand. What's making you
like this? What's going on in your head?

812
01:17:17,612 --> 01:17:20,011
I don't know,
and I don't want to know.

813
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:24,051
But one thing I do want. I want
you to get rid of those books.

814
01:17:24,091 --> 01:17:27,529
- Take them away, Montag. Please.
- I will. I promise.

815
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:31,089
- I'll do it myself if you like.
- No, I'll do it... After I've read them.

816
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:34,567
No, now.
Do it right now, Montag.

817
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,567
I'll leave you.

818
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,087
I can't live
with those.

819
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,086
You've got
to make a choice.

820
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:44,531
Answer me, Montag.

821
01:17:44,566 --> 01:17:46,565
How can I answer, Linda?

822
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,084
I just don't know.

823
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:21,117
Excuse me. Do you know the girl who
lives here with her uncle? Clarisse.

824
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:24,562
- They came for them.
- Who?

825
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:28,116
- To take them away.
- The police?

826
01:18:29,635 --> 01:18:32,635
Not the police?
The firemen?

827
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:40,633
They came to take them away.
They do that now, don't they?

828
01:18:40,673 --> 01:18:43,112
Only to question them.
They let them come back.

829
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:46,077
You can't tell, can you?

830
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:49,631
They weren't like us.
They were special.

831
01:18:50,152 --> 01:18:52,631
You see over there?

832
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:56,114
And there.

833
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:59,150
And there too.
Do you see?

834
01:18:59,189 --> 01:19:02,149
Now look at their house.

835
01:19:02,188 --> 01:19:04,628
There's nothing.

836
01:19:13,146 --> 01:19:16,145
Here, you! Come here!
What's the meaning of this?

837
01:19:16,664 --> 01:19:20,104
Sir... Look! How often must
I talk to you about this?

838
01:19:20,145 --> 01:19:22,663
I talked to you about it in the
office the other day, didn't I?

839
01:19:22,704 --> 01:19:26,663
Why can't you do what you're
told? Eh? Why can't you?

840
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:29,662
Look! Look at you!
Look!

841
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:32,661
Did I tell you to...
Haven't you got a head?

842
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:45,179
- Is the captain in?
- He just stepped out.

843
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:47,699
- Didn't you pass him?
- No.

844
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:54,684
Captain.

845
01:20:54,718 --> 01:20:56,647
Yeah?

846
01:20:56,683 --> 01:20:59,202
The people who were
arrested last night, sir.

847
01:20:59,683 --> 01:21:02,201
It's about time.

848
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:06,201
- How long have you been with us?
- Three years, sir.

849
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,680
Yes, you're a good man.

850
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,200
Remind me to give you one
of my personal medallions.

851
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:14,719
The likeness is remarkable.
You'll see.

852
01:21:14,758 --> 01:21:18,198
I, uh...
You, uh...

853
01:21:18,718 --> 01:21:21,238
I already
have one, sir.

854
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:19,225
Oh, so it was you, was it?
How did you get in?

855
01:22:19,265 --> 01:22:23,263
I needed some information about some
arrests that were made last night.

856
01:22:23,303 --> 01:22:26,224
I wanted to see
some identifications.

857
01:22:26,263 --> 01:22:28,783
Ah! So Montag's handling
the arrests now, is he?

858
01:22:28,817 --> 01:22:30,747
Oh, no, sir,
not at all.

859
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:33,262
Last night, you said. But the
identifications wouldn't be there.

860
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,260
Not yet. In fact,
they've just been handed to me.

861
01:22:38,261 --> 01:22:40,780
Let's see now.

862
01:22:42,299 --> 01:22:45,299
Let's see if they're
amongst this lot.

863
01:22:46,779 --> 01:22:49,778
- Oh, they're the ones!
- I see.

864
01:22:51,778 --> 01:22:54,296
A little young
for him... I'd say.

865
01:22:54,337 --> 01:22:56,741
He's her uncle.

866
01:22:56,776 --> 01:23:00,295
- Friends of yours?
- Oh, no, sir. I know them slightly.

867
01:23:00,336 --> 01:23:02,260
- They live nearby.
- Ah.

868
01:23:02,294 --> 01:23:06,294
- And you'd like their house, is that it?
- Yes, sir, that's it.

869
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:08,778
Well, the house will have
to be requisitioned,

870
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:11,813
But you can't move in until
the niece has been arrested too.

871
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:14,812
Oh, she...
She's still at large then?

872
01:23:15,292 --> 01:23:17,256
For the moment, yes.

873
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:21,331
Look at the identification.
It hasn't been stamped yet.

874
01:23:21,365 --> 01:23:23,849
It's just a matter
of a day or two.

875
01:23:23,885 --> 01:23:26,330
We'll get you
your house. Hmm?

876
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:28,809
How did you get in?

877
01:23:29,809 --> 01:23:33,808
Oh, now,
what's all this about?

878
01:23:33,848 --> 01:23:37,772
Hmm? Still shaky?

879
01:23:37,808 --> 01:23:39,771
You shouldn't have come in.

880
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:42,306
Look at you.
You look like death.

881
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:44,806
Some fresh air,
that's what you need.

882
01:23:44,846 --> 01:23:48,284
A nice bit of fresh air
will put you right again.

883
01:23:48,325 --> 01:23:53,843
Incidentally, if you see that niece
wandering about this part of the world,

884
01:23:53,884 --> 01:23:56,323
You might let us know.

885
01:23:56,842 --> 01:23:58,842
It might expedite
the matter of the house.

886
01:23:58,878 --> 01:24:01,322
Of course, sir.

887
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:49,538
- Clarisse, I must talk to you.
- Not here.

888
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:52,298
- What happened?
- Uncle was arrested.

889
01:25:52,337 --> 01:25:54,262
I got away.

890
01:25:54,297 --> 01:25:56,776
But how did it happen?

891
01:25:56,815 --> 01:26:00,296
They came last night. We
were all asleep. Come on.

892
01:26:00,336 --> 01:26:03,814
Look, I have to get home.
It's terribly important.

893
01:26:07,294 --> 01:26:09,793
Uncle woke me up and
told me to get away.

894
01:26:09,828 --> 01:26:12,293
I escaped through the
skylight over the roof.

895
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,812
This is the last place
you should have come to.

896
01:26:14,847 --> 01:26:17,811
I know, but there's
something I must find.

897
01:26:17,851 --> 01:26:20,811
Look, please stay with me.
I'm frightened.

898
01:26:20,851 --> 01:26:23,809
All right,
I'll stay with you.

899
01:26:37,847 --> 01:26:40,327
- It must be here somewhere.
- What must be here?

900
01:26:40,366 --> 01:26:43,326
Something.
Something I have to find.

901
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,805
- Find and destroy.
- Let me look.

902
01:26:45,846 --> 01:26:49,844
- You wouldn't know where to start looking.
- It was my job.

903
01:26:50,324 --> 01:26:53,324
- How big?
- About this big.

904
01:26:53,844 --> 01:26:56,323
- Papers.
- Oh.

905
01:26:57,362 --> 01:26:59,802
It's no use.

906
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:04,081
- We'll find it. Don't you worry.
- It's a list of addresses.

907
01:27:04,121 --> 01:27:08,360
Friends of my uncle; who they
are and where they're hiding.

908
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,359
We'll find it.

909
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,878
What are you doing?

910
01:27:33,355 --> 01:27:35,874
We must destroy these.

911
01:28:00,389 --> 01:28:03,868
I always wanted
to tell you...

912
01:28:03,907 --> 01:28:08,906
Our meeting in the
monorail was no accident.

913
01:28:08,947 --> 01:28:11,906
I noticed you,
and I followed you.

914
01:28:12,906 --> 01:28:15,905
I thought
you could help us.

915
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:18,389
I knew it when that old
woman killed herself.

916
01:28:18,424 --> 01:28:22,903
I realized there was a
connection between you. Yes.

917
01:28:22,944 --> 01:28:27,423
She was afraid she'd talk
and give us away. Yes.

918
01:28:27,462 --> 01:28:29,867
And I...

919
01:28:29,902 --> 01:28:32,422
This morning, what do I do? I
get into a little bit of trouble,

920
01:28:32,462 --> 01:28:34,901
And I faint
like a silly, little girl.

921
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:40,380
I can't be a fireman anymore.
What is that over there?

922
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:44,898
That? That's a rocking chair.
People used to sit...

923
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:48,418
Outside their houses on warm evenings
and rock backwards and forwards.

924
01:28:48,938 --> 01:28:52,938
- Oh, really?
- Talking to anyone passing by.

925
01:28:52,972 --> 01:28:56,936
Just talking. We'll have
to go away from here.

926
01:28:57,936 --> 01:29:00,415
I know a place.

927
01:29:00,455 --> 01:29:05,454
My uncle told me what to do if
ever he was... If ever he was taken.

928
01:29:05,935 --> 01:29:09,693
You follow the river upstream 'til
you come to the old steam railway line.

929
01:29:09,733 --> 01:29:13,452
Then you go on and you go on until
you get to where the book people live.

930
01:29:13,493 --> 01:29:17,451
- The good people?
- No, book. The book people.

931
01:29:17,971 --> 01:29:20,411
You've not heard of them? No.

932
01:29:20,451 --> 01:29:25,450
People who vanished. Some were
arrested and managed to escape.

933
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:30,448
Others were released. Some didn't wait to
be arrested. They just hid themselves away.

934
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:35,247
Up in the farm country; the woods and the
hills. They live there in little groups.

935
01:29:35,288 --> 01:29:39,967
The law can't touch them. They live quite
peaceably and do nothing that's forbidden.

936
01:29:40,006 --> 01:29:42,966
Though, if they came into the
city, they might not last long.

937
01:29:43,005 --> 01:29:45,865
But how can you
call them book people...

938
01:29:45,901 --> 01:29:48,725
If they don't do anything
against the law?

939
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:52,484
They are books.
Each one, men and women,

940
01:29:52,964 --> 01:29:58,482
Everyone, commits a book they've chosen
to memory, and they become the books.

941
01:29:58,522 --> 01:30:03,481
Of course, every now and then,
someone gets stopped, arrested.

942
01:30:03,521 --> 01:30:06,001
Which is why
they live so cautiously.

943
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:11,998
Because the secret they carry is the
most precious secret in the world.

944
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:15,998
With them, all human knowledge
would pass away.

945
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:19,518
- You must come with me.
- Oh, no, not yet.

946
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:24,996
Uh, it is too soon for me.
I was still burning books.

947
01:30:25,036 --> 01:30:28,476
Yes, in time, perhaps.

948
01:30:28,516 --> 01:30:32,515
But now everything in my life
has suddenly changed.

949
01:30:32,555 --> 01:30:34,994
I must stay in the city.
I have a plan.

950
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:38,033
I will hide a book in every
fireman's house and then denounce him.

951
01:30:38,513 --> 01:30:40,993
The system will eat itself.

952
01:30:41,033 --> 01:30:46,512
We must burn
the pyromaniacs out.

953
01:30:46,552 --> 01:30:49,031
Now we have to go.

954
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,995
Separately.

955
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:58,029
You to your book people
and me to strip this off.

956
01:30:58,069 --> 01:31:00,988
We shall see
each other again.

957
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:03,547
No, we shan't.
Why pretend we shall?

958
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:07,028
You are right.
We shan't.

959
01:31:43,218 --> 01:31:46,218
Fit and well again? Good, excellent.
Come on, hurry, no time to lose.

960
01:31:46,259 --> 01:31:48,218
I'm sorry, sir. I was
on my way to tell you...

961
01:31:48,258 --> 01:31:51,216
I shan't be staying
with the force, sir.

962
01:31:51,257 --> 01:31:55,696
Shan't be? But this isn't
how things are done, Montag.

963
01:31:55,736 --> 01:31:58,735
Not on the eve of promotion.
I shan't be coming in tomorrow.

964
01:31:58,775 --> 01:32:02,734
Tomorrow's another day.
Today you're under my command.

965
01:32:02,774 --> 01:32:06,254
Montag, I'm asking you,
as one man to another.

966
01:32:06,294 --> 01:32:09,213
Please. Please!

967
01:32:09,253 --> 01:32:12,252
You can't let me down like this in front
of the men, not in front of the others.

968
01:32:12,292 --> 01:32:18,251
Just this one last call.
Then you can do as you like.

969
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:20,770
Montag.

970
01:33:31,834 --> 01:33:34,555
This is my house!

971
01:33:34,594 --> 01:33:37,313
Mm-hmm, that's right.

972
01:33:45,311 --> 01:33:48,311
- Linda!
- I couldn't bear it.

973
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:51,830
I just couldn't bear it
anymore.

974
01:33:57,349 --> 01:34:01,828
Well, now, Montag knows
exactly what we're looking for.

975
01:34:02,348 --> 01:34:04,793
I think we can
leave it to him.

976
01:34:04,827 --> 01:34:10,306
To know how to find, one must first
know how to hide. Isn't that so?

977
01:34:10,346 --> 01:34:13,346
I like a man who knows his work. You
men, just check the rest of the house.

978
01:34:19,344 --> 01:34:24,862
Everything ready, Fabian?
Come on, hurry it up.

979
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:35,860
Come on,
bring us the sparkler.

980
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:39,860
As this is Montag's home, I think,
perhaps, he should do the honours.

981
01:34:46,858 --> 01:34:50,897
What are you doing in there!
Have you gone mad?

982
01:34:52,376 --> 01:34:58,335
Come on, get back in there!
Just the books! The books!

983
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:02,375
What do you think you're doing?
There's no need for that!

984
01:35:03,894 --> 01:35:06,373
I said the books, Montag!

985
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:11,892
That's good.
That's what I like to see.

986
01:35:11,927 --> 01:35:16,851
Sweet reason.
Novels aren't life.

987
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:20,410
What did Montag hope
to get out of all this print?

988
01:35:20,891 --> 01:35:24,409
Happiness? What a poor
idiot you must have been.

989
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:27,369
This gibberish is enough
to drive a man mad.

990
01:35:27,409 --> 01:35:31,407
Thought you could learn from these
how to walk on the waters, did you?

991
01:35:31,448 --> 01:35:33,373
Montag must learn
to think a little.

992
01:35:33,408 --> 01:35:36,927
Consider how all these writings, all
these recipes for happiness disagree.

993
01:35:36,966 --> 01:35:40,406
Now let this heap of
contradictions burn itself out.

994
01:35:40,926 --> 01:35:45,404
You know it's we who, at this moment,
are working for man's happiness.

995
01:35:45,445 --> 01:35:47,890
Look, isn't that lovely?
The pages,

996
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:52,883
Like flower petals or
butterflies, luminous and black.

997
01:35:52,923 --> 01:35:58,921
Who can explain the fascination
of fire? What draws us to it?

998
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:01,921
Whether we're young or old.

999
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:13,986
Nothing to say?
That's the spirit.

1000
01:37:14,505 --> 01:37:16,470
That's real wisdom.
He still has one.

1001
01:37:16,504 --> 01:37:21,464
What have you got there?
Is this your special book?

1002
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:23,983
It's got to be burned with the
others, and you're under arrest.

1003
01:37:42,499 --> 01:37:45,018
Montag.

1004
01:37:53,016 --> 01:37:55,976
Get out of there!

1005
01:37:56,016 --> 01:38:00,014
Everybody, out of here quick!
He's gone mad!

1006
01:38:04,534 --> 01:38:08,013
Right now! Go!

1007
01:38:28,849 --> 01:38:32,848
Watch for a man running
through the streets.

1008
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:37,366
Repeating.
Calling all citizens.

1009
01:38:37,407 --> 01:38:40,806
Wanted for murder.
Montag.

1010
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:43,810
Fireman.

1011
01:38:43,846 --> 01:38:47,125
The criminal is alone
and on foot.

1012
01:38:47,165 --> 01:38:50,363
Let each one stand
at his front door.

1013
01:38:50,404 --> 01:38:53,844
Look and listen.

1014
01:38:53,883 --> 01:38:56,882
Watch for a man running
through the streets.

1015
01:38:57,362 --> 01:39:01,361
Repeating.
Calling all citizens.

1016
01:39:01,881 --> 01:39:04,841
Wanted for murder.
Montag.

1017
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,841
Fireman.

1018
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,378
The criminal is alone
and on foot.

1019
01:39:11,414 --> 01:39:14,879
Let each one stand
at his front door.

1020
01:39:14,918 --> 01:39:18,398
Look and listen.

1021
01:42:22,957 --> 01:42:25,196
I am, uh... Yes, we know who you are.

1022
01:42:25,231 --> 01:42:27,400
You're the man of the hour. Come.

1023
01:42:27,435 --> 01:42:30,715
Come and witness your
own capture. My capture?

1024
01:42:30,755 --> 01:42:33,954
That's right. Our
beautiful cousin is being...

1025
01:42:33,993 --> 01:42:36,474
Particularly
entertaining today.

1026
01:42:36,514 --> 01:42:38,953
You'll see.

1027
01:42:40,472 --> 01:42:42,437
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1028
01:42:42,473 --> 01:42:46,471
I am the journal of Henri
Brilard by Stendhal.

1029
01:42:55,989 --> 01:43:00,987
Montag is still at large,
but time is running out fast.

1030
01:43:01,028 --> 01:43:02,953
Ah, there it is.

1031
01:43:02,987 --> 01:43:06,226
The aerial patrol
has sighted the wanted man.

1032
01:43:06,267 --> 01:43:09,467
They can't keep the viewers
waiting much longer.

1033
01:43:09,506 --> 01:43:11,945
The show must go on.
They'll find somebody.

1034
01:43:11,985 --> 01:43:17,465
Anybody will do to provide them
with their climax.

1035
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:21,944
There he is.
You can see him clearly now.

1036
01:43:21,983 --> 01:43:24,982
There is Montag,
running headlong into the trap,

1037
01:43:26,502 --> 01:43:29,502
Scurrying about
like a frightened rat.

1038
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:38,500
Just look at him, cousins.

1039
01:44:05,014 --> 01:44:10,013
It's all over, cousins.
Montag is dead.

1040
01:44:10,532 --> 01:44:15,492
A crime against society
has been avenged.

1041
01:44:15,531 --> 01:44:19,011
They never showed the man's face
properly. It was too far away, of course.

1042
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:23,529
Even your friends are bound
to believe you're dead.

1043
01:44:26,009 --> 01:44:29,528
Here. You may as well
shed your old skin.

1044
01:44:30,048 --> 01:44:32,048
"The moon was shining
sulkily...

1045
01:44:34,047 --> 01:44:36,527
"because she thought the sun...

1046
01:44:37,047 --> 01:44:40,525
"had got no business
to be there...

1047
01:44:41,045 --> 01:44:43,525
"after the day was done.

1048
01:44:44,045 --> 01:44:48,044
'It's very rude of him,'
she said."

1049
01:44:51,564 --> 01:44:53,563
Are you interested
in Plato's Republic?

1050
01:44:53,597 --> 01:44:56,003
Uh... Well, I am Plato's Republic.

1051
01:44:56,043 --> 01:45:00,041
I'll recite myself for you whenever
you like. Thank you very much.

1052
01:45:00,081 --> 01:45:03,041
Now here's Wuthering Heights
by Emily Bronte.

1053
01:45:03,081 --> 01:45:05,560
And here's The Corsair
by Byron.

1054
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,519
She used to be married
to a chief of police.

1055
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,518
Now that skinny fellow is Alice
in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.

1056
01:45:13,558 --> 01:45:17,558
Where's Alice through the looking-glass today?
She should be somewhere about.

1057
01:45:17,598 --> 01:45:20,076
There's Pilgrim's Progress
by John Bunyan.

1058
01:45:20,117 --> 01:45:22,557
He ate his book
so they couldn't burn it.

1059
01:45:22,597 --> 01:45:24,521
Waiting for Godot
by Samuel Beckett.

1060
01:45:24,556 --> 01:45:28,074
Oh, you see the little blonde
coming towards us? Watch her blush.

1061
01:45:28,115 --> 01:45:31,594
I'm Jean-Paul Sartre's The Jewish Question.
Delighted to meet you.

1062
01:45:34,073 --> 01:45:36,594
I'm The Martian Chronicles
by Ray Bradbury.

1063
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,037
Allow me to introduce...
Oh. May I?

1064
01:45:41,072 --> 01:45:45,071
The Pickwick Papers, Charles Dickens.
Oh, Charles Dickens.

1065
01:45:45,112 --> 01:45:47,036
Once I read a book
he wrote:

1066
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:50,111
David Copperfield. We have
a David Copperfield amongst us.

1067
01:45:50,145 --> 01:45:53,346
He's with another group
in the south.

1068
01:45:53,381 --> 01:45:56,549
I am The Prince by Machiavelli. Oh.

1069
01:45:56,589 --> 01:45:58,588
As you see, you can't
judge a book by its cover.

1070
01:46:08,626 --> 01:46:11,106
I am Jane Austin's
Pride and Prejudice.

1071
01:46:11,146 --> 01:46:13,624
I am Jane Austin's
Pride and Prejudice.

1072
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,590
Both of you the same book?

1073
01:46:15,625 --> 01:46:18,624
My brother is volume one.
My brother is volume two.

1074
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:21,103
It's a great pleasure
to meet you.

1075
01:46:24,103 --> 01:46:26,067
We call the first one Pride.

1076
01:46:26,102 --> 01:46:29,142
The other one's Prejudice.
I don't think they like it much.

1077
01:47:18,651 --> 01:47:22,650
Here, we're only 50 or so, but there
are many, many more scattered around.

1078
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:27,168
In abandoned railway yards,
wandering the roads.

1079
01:47:27,209 --> 01:47:30,168
Tramps outwardly,
but, inwardly, libraries.

1080
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:32,652
Oh, it wasn't planned.

1081
01:47:32,687 --> 01:47:37,166
It just so happened that a man here
and a man there loved some book.

1082
01:47:37,686 --> 01:47:39,686
And rather than lose it,
he learned it.

1083
01:47:39,721 --> 01:47:43,131
And we came together.

1084
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:48,683
We're a minority of undesirables
crying out in the wilderness.

1085
01:47:48,723 --> 01:47:51,163
But it won't
always be so.

1086
01:47:51,204 --> 01:47:55,202
One day we shall be called on, one
by one, to recite what we've learned.

1087
01:47:55,242 --> 01:47:58,202
And then books
will be printed again.

1088
01:47:58,242 --> 01:48:01,160
And when the next
age of darkness comes,

1089
01:48:01,201 --> 01:48:05,201
Those who come after us will
do again as we have done.

1090
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,719
I have one with me. Yes?

1091
01:48:14,198 --> 01:48:17,157
What is it?
Let me see.

1092
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:21,197
"Tales of Mystery and
Imagination by Edgar Allen Poe."

1093
01:48:24,196 --> 01:48:27,714
Learn it quickly, so that
we can burn it. You burn it?

1094
01:48:27,755 --> 01:48:31,234
We have to, so that no one
can take them away from us.

1095
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:33,679
Yes, we burn the books.

1096
01:48:33,713 --> 01:48:38,673
But we keep them up here
where nobody can find them.

1097
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:43,712
As a matter of fact, we've just
burned the memoirs of Saint Simon.

1098
01:48:45,231 --> 01:48:48,710
You see, Montag, that man over
there hasn't much longer to live.

1099
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:52,750
He's the Weir of Hermiston by Robert
Louis Stevenson. The boy is his nephew.

1100
01:48:52,784 --> 01:48:56,190
He's now reciting himself,
so the boy can become the book.

1101
01:48:56,229 --> 01:49:01,227
"'I will be very quiet,' replied
Archie. And I will be boldly frank.

1102
01:49:01,267 --> 01:49:06,226
I do not love my father. I wonder
sometimes if I do not hate him."

1103
01:49:06,747 --> 01:49:10,746
"'I will be very quiet,' replied
Archie. And I will be boldly frank.

1104
01:49:10,786 --> 01:49:14,745
I do not love my father. I wonder
sometimes if I do not hate him."

1105
01:49:14,784 --> 01:49:17,224
"There's my shame,
perhaps my sin.

1106
01:49:17,264 --> 01:49:20,743
At least, and in the sight
of god, not my fault."

1107
01:49:20,783 --> 01:49:23,223
"There's my shame,
perhaps my sin.

1108
01:49:23,263 --> 01:49:26,262
At least, and in the sight
of god, not my fault."

1109
01:49:26,302 --> 01:49:28,706
"How was I to love him?

1110
01:49:28,741 --> 01:49:32,260
"He has never spoken to me,
never smiled upon me.

1111
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:35,220
I do not think
he ever touched me."

1112
01:49:35,259 --> 01:49:39,259
"How was I to love him? He has never
spoken to me, never smiled upon me.

1113
01:49:39,299 --> 01:49:41,224
And I do not think
he ever touched me."

1114
01:49:41,258 --> 01:49:44,258
"He was more afraid of death
than of anything else.

1115
01:49:44,778 --> 01:49:47,777
"And he died
as he thought he would,

1116
01:49:47,817 --> 01:49:50,737
while the first snows
of winter fell."

1117
01:49:50,777 --> 01:49:54,536
"He was more afraid of death
than of anything else.

1118

- "And he died... "
- "And he died while the first... "

1120

1131
01:51:15,838 --> 01:51:19,357
"I'm going to relate
a tale full of horror."

1132
01:51:34,873 --> 01:51:38,352
"I would gladly suppress it,
were it not a chronicle."

1133
01:51:42,872 --> 01:51:46,131
"Now, how much there is
to tell... "

1134

{1525}{1573}It was around 1912.
{1566}{1644}Jules, a foreigner in Paris,|askedJim, whom he hardly knew,
{1631}{1683}to get him into the Art Students'Ball.
{1675}{1767}Jim got him a ticket|and a costume.
{1751}{1869}WhileJules was hunting for|a slave costume...
{1848}{1915}their friendship was born.
{1904}{2042}It grew as Jules watched the ball|with his kind tender eyes.
{2036}{2147}The next day, they had|their first real conversation.
{2127}{2218}Each taught the other his language|and his culture until late at night.
{2202}{2285}They translated|each other's poetry.
{2284}{2365}They shared|an indifference for money.
{2352}{2461}They talked,|and they listened to each other.
{2441}{2526}Jules had no girls in Paris|and he wanted one.
{2512}{2621}Jim had several.|He introducedJules to a musician.
{2601}{2712}They were in love for about a week.
{2693}{2839}Then came a sweet thing|who loved to talk all night.
{2812}{2907}And a pretty blonde widow|who made them a trio.
{2890}{2956}She confusedJules.|She found him nice, but clumsy.
{2946}{3043}She brought him a quiet friend|who was too quiet.
{3026}{3122}DespiteJim's advice,Jules|got in contact with professionals...
{3105}{3170}but found no satisfaction.
{3289}{3332}Let's get to work.
{3675}{3767}"Down with everything"

{3947}{4012}He's stronger than you!|Let's run!
{4043}{4091}Can you put me up for the night?

{4136}{4203}You can't stay with me.|I've got a date.
{4192}{4319}Gilberte? ButJules can...|That's me...
{4296}{4367}And who're you?|Jim and Jules, then?
{4355}{4413}No,Jules and Jim.
{4974}{5008}What's that?
{5021}{5169}It's better than a clock.|When the sand stops, I must go to sleep.
{5519}{5622}- You'll sleep here and me there.|- I see.
{5604}{5682}- Got a cigarette?|- Of course.
{5737}{5802}- Are you Jim?|- No,Jules.
{5818}{5871}You're sweet.
{5940}{5999}I'll show you a steam engine.
{6477}{6515}It's almost dawn.
{6510}{6608}Jim, you might stay here|with me for once.
{6591}{6635}No, Gilberte.
{6629}{6721}If I stayed only once,|I'd feel guilty.
{6705}{6807}If I stayed longer,|we'd be almost married.
{6789}{6884}- That's against our rules!|- What a twisted mind.
{6868}{6954}And the cat doesn't like|to stay at home alone.
{6939}{7017}Besides, it's morning.
{7004}{7093}Just imagine that I'm going to work.
{7196}{7293}You're going home to sleep until noon.
{7786}{7904}No, it was Shakespeare.
{7983}{8049}Give me a dime for the music.
{8038}{8136}It was Shakespeare,|I tell you.
{8305}{8360}Do you have a cigarette?
{8536}{8628}Can you put me up for the night?|I'm Therese.
{8817}{8952}Forget it. There are more|where she came from.
{8944}{9054}I wasn't in love with her.
{9034}{9115}She was both mother and daughter to me.
{9160}{9223}I'm not lucky in Paris.
{9213}{9299}Good thing I know girls back home.
{9288}{9354}I love one, Lucie.
{9344}{9413}She refused to marry me.
{9401}{9496}I've decided to wait 6 months,|and ask her again.
{9507}{9590}There's another, too.|Birgitta.
{9576}{9643}And there's Elga.
{9632}{9732}I'd love her|if I didn't love Lucie.
{9714}{9788}This is what she looks like.
{9881}{9987}Jules sketched a woman's face|on the table.
{10026}{10091}Jim wanted to buy the table...
{10081}{10166}but the owner wanted|to sell the whole set.
{10237}{10266}Albert.
{10296}{10346}This is Jim, a French friend.
{10482}{10540}Hello. I think we've met before.
{10579}{10626}Sit down.
{10716}{10781}- Jim had asked...|- Who is Albert?
{10771}{10853}The artists'friend.
{10839}{10952}He knows everyone|who'll be famous in ten years.
{11031}{11097}This is more exotic.
{11086}{11175}She looks like an Incan statue.
{11188}{11303}This one is somewhat Romanesque.
{11283}{11405}It's weathered because|I found it in the garden.
{11383}{11445}It was out in the rain for years.
{11435}{11557}This one is very touching.
{11583}{11671}Reminds you of a decaying face.
{11656}{11781}Strange to see stone|worked so flabbily.
{11879}{11957}This face has beautiful lips.
{11944}{12026}They're scornful.|Admirable eyes, too.
{12092}{12169}May we see that last one again?
{12232}{12305}I made a close-up of it, too.
{12293}{12360}The slide showed|a woman's face...
{12349}{12423}whose tranquil smile gripped them.
{12432}{12565}The statue was in an outdoor museum|on an Adriatic island.
{12541}{12615}They left immediately to see it.
{12602}{12661}They wore|the same white outfits.
{12822}{12917}They stared at the face|for an hour.
{12900}{12964}It stunned them into silence.
{12954}{13065}They were speechless.|Had they ever met such a smile?
{13045}{13152}No. If they ever met it,|they would follow it.
{13158}{13255}Jules andJim|returned home dazzled.
{13255}{13287}Paris greeted them gently.
{13728}{13826}- How is your book?|- It's coming along.
{13844}{13957}It will be rather autobiographical.
{13937}{14019}Our friendship had|a major part in it.
{14005}{14049}I'd love to have you read|an excerpt from it.
{14043}{14076}Please do.
{14251}{14310}"Jacques and Julien were inseparable.
{14301}{14368}Julien's last novel|was successful.
{14357}{14443}In it, he described|the enchanting women he had known...
{14429}{14510}...before he had metJacques|and even Lucienne.
{14496}{14552}Jacques was proud ofJulien.
{14545}{14598}People called them|Don Quixote and Sancho Panza...
{14589}{14689}and they never knew that neighbors|found their friendship ambiguous.
{14672}{14734}They ate together|in small restaurants.
{14724}{14833}They bought for one another|the best cigars. "
{14814}{14868}It's beautiful.
{14859}{14997}Let me translate it into German.
{14972}{15024}Now, for a shower.
{15108}{15173}My cousin just wrote me.
{15174}{15278}Three girls he knows|are coming to Paris.
{15260}{15345}One is German, one is Dutch,|and one is French.
{15331}{15420}They're coming to dinner tomorrow.
{15405}{15463}I want you to join us.
{15587}{15691}Catherine, the French girl,|was the statue.
{15674}{15741}She had the same smile, nose,|mouth, chin, and forehead.
{15731}{15799}As a child, she had|been idolized in her hometown...
{15787}{15828}during a religious celebration.
{15823}{15863}It started almost like a dream.
{15857}{15979}As your host, I propose...
{15957}{16105}that we would abolish|all formalities forever...
{16084}{16222}by drinking my best wine|in brotherhood.
{16196}{16309}Instead of linking arms|in the usual way...
{16289}{16395}let us touch feet under the table.
{16376}{16484}Jules was happy|and moved his feet away.
{16465}{16537}Jim's foot stayed near Catherine's.
{16525}{16593}She moved hers away first.
{16616}{16689}Jules smiled happily...
{16677}{16744}as he beamed at the others.
{16776}{16823}Jules vanished for a month.
{16816}{16860}He saw Catherine alone...
{16853}{16951}but the two friends|met at the gymnasium.
{17017}{17054}Excellent.
{17058}{17157}Why don't you spend the evening|with Catherine and me?
{17232}{17284}I've talked about you so much...
{17276}{17398}Catherine is anxious|to know you better...
{17376}{17486}but not this one,Jim. Okay?
{17644}{17694}Hello, Mr. Jim.
{17780}{17890}Pronounce his name in English,|not French.
{17939}{18022}"Jeem" doesn't suit him.
{18162}{18254}Do you like our friend Thomas?
{18248}{18312}Can we go out with him?
{18316}{18425}Not bad. A moustache would help.
{18707}{18769}Now for a test in the street.
{19005}{19107}Excuse me, sir.|Do you have a match?
{19215}{19256}Thank you, sir.
{19322}{19385}She was proud|of her clever disguise.
{19375}{19470}The men were moved,|but didn't really understand why.
{19454}{19553}- Either it's raining or I'm dreaming!|- It might be both.
{19738}{19804}Then if it's raining,|let's go to the seashore.
{19805}{19834}We go tomorrow.
{19878}{19967}Let's have a race.
{19952}{20033}First one to the end of the bridge.
{20634}{20697}- You cheated.|- But I won.
{20687}{20726}Thomas always wins.
{20720}{20806}He speaks three languages,|he swims like a fish.
{20792}{20839}Can he stand on his hands?
{20832}{20872}You'll teach him.
{20903}{20986}Can you come to my flat tomorrow...
{20972}{21074}to help take my baggage|to the station?
{21104}{21139}She's a strange breed.
{21134}{21241}Her father was an aristocrat,|her mother wasn't.
{21222}{21351}He came from Burgundy.|Her mother was English.
{21328}{21402}That's why she's not average...
{21390}{21460}and she teaches everyone.
{21449}{21523}- Teaches what?|- Shakespeare.
{21571}{21681}Jim took it for granted|that she belonged toJules.
{21662}{21745}Catherine wore that calm smile.
{21730}{21818}It was natural and said everything.
{21914}{21992}I'm almost ready.|I just have to put on my dress.
{21994}{22065}- Never put a hat on a bed.|- Do we take the bike?
{22265}{22299}And the bag, too?
{22376}{22459}- What are you doing?|- I want to burn lies.
{22479}{22518}Give me a match.
{22747}{22836}- Oh, my God!|- Don't move.
{23104}{23186}- Are you alright?|- Hand me the dress.
{23172}{23210}It's by the bed.
{23356}{23430}- Got a broom?|- It's under your nose.
{23922}{23960}Can you help me?
{24183}{24212}Thanks.
{24350}{24399}We'll take this, too.
{24428}{24460}What is it?
{24456}{24538}Vitriol, for the eyes of men who lie.
{24532}{24606}That bottle will break|and ruin your things.
{24594}{24659}Besides, you can buy Vitriol anywhere.
{24648}{24712}- Is that true?|- Yes.
{24702}{24761}But not this bottle.
{24752}{24821}I swore I'd only use this bottle.
{25793}{25836}It took them a while...
{25829}{25932}to find the house of their dreams|along the coast.
{25915}{26010}It was too big and isolated,|solemn, white, and empty.
{26071}{26139}- Sleep well?|- Very well.
{26128}{26226}- Is Jim awake?|- I don't know.
{26328}{26412}- How is everyone else?|- Everyone else is fine.
{26441}{26478}What a nice day.
{26492}{26552}Hurry, let's go to the beach.
{26695}{26788}Let's find the last signs|of civilization.
{26772}{26824}A piece of tire.
{26893}{27035}- Look, a bottle!|- An old shoe.
{27233}{27351}A can!|Watch out back there.
{27473}{27524}Look, Catherine.
{27652}{27726}Watch out, it's steep.
{27816}{27856}A postcard.
{27981}{28039}A piece of porcelain.
{28068}{28141}A cup and a cigarette butt.
{28273}{28393}- A pack of English cigarettes.|- I'm afraid we're lost, kids.
{28724}{28806}Do you think I should marry her?
{28792}{28851}Answer me honestly.
{28842}{28915}Is she cut out|to be a wife and mother?
{28903}{29013}I'm afraid she will never|be happy on this earth.
{28994}{29095}She has a vision. Maybe|she can't belong to just one man.
{29077}{29141}- Let's go.|- No.
{29130}{29212}This time, I won't move.|I give up.
{29576}{29671}Help me, kids.
{30037}{30120}Let's go, kids.
{30704}{30758}At last, I read a book I liked.
{30749}{30828}A writer, a German, of course...
{30815}{30896}who dares to say out loud|what I think inside.
{30882}{30991}The sky that we see is merely|a small hollow ball...
{30972}{31031}no bigger than that.
{31022}{31142}And we walk|with our heads towards the center.
{31383}{31494}The attraction pulls towards|the outside under our feet...
{31474}{31600}towards that solid crust|in which the bubble is enclosed.
{31578}{31637}How thick is the crust|and what's beyond it?
{31627}{31656}Go and see.
{31653}{31732}That's not a question|to discuss between gentlemen.
{32022}{32084}Answer me tomorrow, Catherine.
{32074}{32116}If you say no...
{32110}{32250}I will ask you every year again|on your birthday.
{32224}{32270}You've known few women.
{32264}{32351}I've known plenty of men.|It averages out.
{32336}{32424}We might make an honest couple.
{32732}{32827}I've proposed to her.|She almost said yes.
{32988}{33074}At fifteen,|I was in love with Napoleon.
{33062}{33148}I dreamt I met him in an elevator.
{33133}{33221}We had a child|and I never saw him again.
{33241}{33296}Poor Napoleon.
{33294}{33373}I was taught:|Our father who arts in heaven.
{33360}{33442}I thought it said arts.
{33428}{33573}I imagined my father with an easel|painting in Paradise.
{33586}{33675}I believe I've said something funny.
{33670}{33798}At least, amusing.|You might try to smile.
{33980}{34088}Will anyone present|scratch my back?
{34069}{34140}The Lord scratches|those who scratch themselves.
{34170}{34243}The Lord scratches those...
{34331}{34397}You two taught me how to laugh.
{34387}{34439}Before, I always looked glum.
{34594}{34687}But that's all over.
{34911}{35010}It's raining. Come and see.
{35088}{35170}I miss Paris.|Let's go back, please.
{35157}{35221}We'll be there tomorrow night.
{35763}{35828}I've sold my book.
{35836}{35899}This is for Catherine.
{35900}{35941}This is for both of you.
{36014}{36127}- What is it?|- A back-scratcher.
{36303}{36389}I'm taking you|to the theater tonight.
{36413}{36540}- What will we see?|- A new Swedish play.
{36559}{36598}It starts at nine.
{36592}{36687}When the sand stops,|we'll get dressed.
{36728}{36806}Jim saw his friends often.
{36793}{36866}He liked to be with them.
{36854}{36974}Jules'two pillows|were now side by side.
{36953}{37026}Catherine learned to live again.
{37320}{37379}I still like that girl.
{37380}{37497}She wants to be free.|She invents her own life.
{37476}{37547}- Doesn'tJim agree?|- No.
{37556}{37600}It's a confused|and self-indulging play.
{37593}{37672}The writer revels in vice|to preach virtue.
{37659}{37756}We don't even know|when or where it's taking place.
{37739}{37828}He doesn't say|if the heroine is a virgin.
{37826}{37871}That's not important.
{37865}{38005}Usually not, but since he explains|that the hero is impotent...
{37980}{38050}that his brother is gay|and that the sister is a nymphomaniac...
{38038}{38112}why should he dismiss the heroine?
{38100}{38158}That's all in your mind.
{38149}{38224}Yes, and you help us think of it.
{38229}{38282}No psychology tonight.
{38274}{38358}It's not psychology,|it's metaphysics.
{38343}{38446}In a couple,|the wife must be faithful.
{38428}{38499}The husband doesn't count.
{38487}{38614}Who wrote: "Woman is natural,|therefore abominable?"
{38591}{38680}Baudelaire. But he meant|a certain class.
{38665}{38766}Not at all.|He meant women in general.
{38748}{38814}Here's how he describes|a young girl:
{38803}{38946}"Monster, assassin of the arts.|Little fool, little slut.
{38920}{39025}A blend of idiocy and depravity. "
{39007}{39103}Wait, that's not all.|This is marvelous:
{39087}{39218}"I wonder why women are|allowed to enter churches.
{39204}{39316}What could they hope|to say to God?"
{39328}{39396}- You're a pair of fools.|- I haven't said anything.
{39385}{39492}And I don't approve|of whatJules says at 2 in the morning.
{39518}{39590}- Then protest!|- I am protesting.
{39792}{39850}Jim never forgot that jump.
{39841}{39939}He drew it the next day,|though he was not an artist.
{39922}{40013}His admiration for Catherine|struck him like lightning...
{39998}{40057}as he blew her an invisible kiss.
{40048}{40077}He didn't worry.
{40073}{40183}He was swimming with her mentally,|and held his breath to frightenJules.
{40188}{40224}Catherine, why?
{40313}{40348}You're crazy.
{40630}{40696}Her hat drifted away.
{40929}{41018}Jules was pale, silent,|unsure of himself, and more handsome.
{41003}{41142}Catherine had a triumphant smile.
{41117}{41162}No one spoke about herjump.
{41217}{41314}- I've arrived.|- Please, Mr. Jim.
{41297}{41392}- No,justJim.|- JustJim.
{41389}{41493}I want to ask you some advice.
{41486}{41595}Can you meet me tomorrow|at 7 in our cafÈ?
{41576}{41609}Yes.
{41604}{41732}- She wants to talk to you.|- Right, I'll be there at 7.
{42185}{42259}- Are you joking?|- I never joke.
{42246}{42314}I've no sense of humor.
{42345}{42466}I know people who have.|My wife's friends, working relations.
{42445}{42528}But personally, I never joke.
{42580}{42676}Jim was late, as usual,|because he was an optimist.
{42659}{42752}He was afraid she had already left.
{42749}{42834}Jim thought.. 'A girl like that...
{42819}{42898}would probably not have waited.
{42885}{42948}A girl like that|might have just walked in...
{42938}{43032}without noticing me|behind my newspaper, and left. "
{43015}{43102}He kept repeating..|'A girl like that. "
{43087}{43137}But what was she like?
{43130}{43225}For the first time,|he began to think of her.
{43306}{43365}Another coffee, please.
{43403}{43491}Another glass.
{44654}{44732}Did I wake you up,Jim?
{44719}{44822}We're going to my country,|to get married.
{44838}{44986}Tell her I'm sorry I was late.|I waited almost till 8.
{44960}{45033}She's more optimistic than you.
{45021}{45110}She was at the hairdresser...
{45094}{45165}and arrived at 8|to have dinner with you.
{45154}{45255}If I had known she'd come,|I could have waited until midnight.
{45237}{45352}Catherine wants to speak to you.
{45356}{45442}I'm very happy,Jim.
{45427}{45505}Jules will teach me French boxing.
{45492}{45574}With an Austrian accent.
{45560}{45686}I've lost my accent!|My French is perfect!
{45663}{45711}Listen to the Marseillaise.
{46529}{46584}A few days later, war was declared.
{46576}{46664}Jules andJim were separated|by their uniforms...
{46648}{46699}and lost touch for a long time.
{48197}{48261}The war was never ending.
{48251}{48321}Gradually, it became|like a normal life...
{48309}{48368}tempered by the different seasons.
{48359}{48485}A normal life with dead beats, routines,|pauses, and even distractions.
{48715}{48784}Gilberte sent parcels toJim.
{48772}{48884}He almost saw her a few times,|but each time his leave was canceled.
{48904}{48998}Then, in 1916,|he spent a week in Paris.
{49012}{49144}Don't marry me for my parcels.|We're fine as we are.
{49120}{49208}All right,|but I know this will last.
{49193}{49314}- How is Jules?|- No news of him since his wedding.
{49293}{49382}Sometimes, I'm afraid|I'll killJules during a battle.
{49638}{49679}My darling...
{49696}{49756}I never stop thinking of you.
{49759}{49847}Not of your soul.|I don't believe in it anymore.
{49846}{49941}But of your body...
{49939}{50038}and our son who is inside you.
{50052}{50169}I've no more envelopes.|I don't know how to mail this letter.
{50180}{50253}I am going to the Russian front.
{50266}{50325}It will be tough...
{50342}{50475}but I prefer it because|I was afraid to kill Jim here.
{50483}{50523}My darling...
{50555}{50625}let me kiss you.
{52025}{52119}Jules'country lost the war.|Jim's had won.
{52102}{52176}But they were both victorious|since they were alive.
{52165}{52289}They began to write each other again.
{52266}{52345}Catherine andJules lived|in a cottage near the Rhine.
{52332}{52404}They had a daughter, Sabine.
{52392}{52540}Jim wroteJules.. "Tell me,|should I marry and have children, too?"
{52514}{52606}Jules replied..|"Come and judge for yourself. "
{52590}{52647}Catherine signed the invitation.
{52638}{52746}Jim left,|but he delayed his arrival.
{52727}{52800}He walked along the Rhine,|and stopped in several towns.
{52788}{52903}He was writing about Germany|after the war for a Paris paper.
{52915}{53000}He wanted to see|his battlegrounds again.
{53042}{53110}In some places, the land|had been bombarded so heavily...
{53099}{53227}that nothing could ever|grow on it again.
{53212}{53349}They became cemeteries whereJim|looked on graves for familiar names...
{53324}{53421}cemeteries that were being shown|to schoolchildren.
{53779}{53859}Catherine was waiting at the station|with her daughter.
{53845}{53933}Her eyes were shining with joy.
{54199}{54255}- Hello,Jim.|- Hello, Catherine.
{54246}{54366}- This is Sabine.|- Hello, Mr. Jim.
{54379}{54428}Let's go.|Jules is anxious to see you.
{54440}{54552}Her deep voice madeJim think|she had finally made their date...
{54532}{54591}and had dressed up|especially for him.
{54582}{54702}She took him to their cottage,|surrounded by pines and near a hill.
{55415}{55493}- How are the others?|- Oh, the others, you know.
{55646}{55712}- You haven't changed,Jim.|- You haven't changed,Jules.
{55701}{55752}So, no one has changed.
{56079}{56109}Sit down.
{56161}{56191}Come here, Sabine.
{56649}{56678}No, thanks.
{56689}{56751}- You want some?|- Just a little.
{56873}{56993}No, thanks. I stopped smoking|when I started to love plants.
{57170}{57239}An angel is passing by.
{57366}{57425}Of course, it's twenty past one.
{57466}{57501}So?
{57496}{57579}Angels always pass by|at twenty past.
{57631}{57739}- I didn't know that.|- Neither did I.
{57886}{57946}At twenty past|and twenty to as well.
{58022}{58145}So you won the war, you louse.
{58123}{58205}I'd rather have won this.
{58276}{58350}You must be hungry. Let's eat.
{58374}{58451}Afterwards, I'll show you the house.
{58557}{58676}Jim here,Jules over there.|And Sabine next to me.
{58754}{58805}How is your new novel?
{58797}{58882}These articles won't let me finish it.
{58868}{58992}I work on them all week,|write them Friday night...
{58969}{59053}and send them airmail|the next day. And you?
{59039}{59126}I am doing a book on dragonflies.
{59111}{59181}I am writing it for a publisher.
{59170}{59252}Catherine is illustrating it.
{59238}{59386}Even Sabine helps.|She goes with me into the swamps.
{59365}{59484}I'm going to build|a pond in the garden.
{59463}{59611}One day, perhaps, I may become literary|and write a love story...
{59584}{59692}with insects as characters.
{59691}{59829}I have a bad tendency to specialize.
{59819}{59922}I admire your versatility,Jim.
{59927}{60053}Oh, me, I'm a failure. Sorel,|my teacher, taught me all I know.
{60037}{60119}"What do you want to do," he asked me.|I said I wanted to be a diplomat.
{60105}{60168}"Do you have money?"|"No. "
{60158}{60305}"Are you related to anyone famous?"|"No. "
{60278}{60395}"Then forget about diplomacy!"|"But what can I become?"
{60374}{60430}"Curious. "|"That's no career. "
{60421}{60471}"Not yet.
{60493}{60553}Travel, write, translate.
{60544}{60641}Learn to live anywhere,|beginning now.
{60624}{60684}There's a future in it.
{60676}{60764}The French have ignored the world|for too long.
{60765}{60839}A paper will always|pay for your fun. "
{60892}{60973}Jules thinks you have|a bright future.
{60959}{61076}So do I,|but it may not be spectacular.
{61113}{61193}Jules works and sleeps here.
{61179}{61267}We're as organized as a monastery.
{61253}{61307}Jules writes his books...
{61298}{61401}and hunts his insects.
{61384}{61482}Mathilde, who you saw,|comes from a nearby farm.
{61465}{61549}She helps me|with the house and Sabine.
{61599}{61628}My room.
{61738}{61772}That's Jules!
{61768}{61911}Yes, his father liked Mozart so much|that he once disguised him as Mozart.
{61938}{61984}Here is the balcony.
{62122}{62194}Over there is the inn|where you'll sleep.
{62182}{62241}Jules will take you there later.
{63993}{64066}Jules and"J"im|carried on their conversation.
{64054}{64156}They tajked about the war.|Jules avoided tajking about his famijy.
{64138}{64200}Catherine was kind and tough...
{64190}{64268}but"J"im fejt something was wrong.
{64479}{64571}To bed, sleepyhead.
{64555}{64630}Once upon a time...
{64635}{64692}there was a little sleepyhead...
{64742}{64847}- Good night, Sabine.|- Good night,Jim. See you tomorrow.
{64898}{64968}- Good night,Jules.|- I want to talk to you.
{65077}{65197}- What do you think of her?|- Marriage and motherhood suit her.
{65176}{65269}She's less of a grasshopper|and more of an ant.
{65348}{65377}Be careful.
{65390}{65476}True, she keeps order in our home.
{65472}{65591}But if things go too smoothly,|she changes.
{65581}{65680}She becomes a tyrant in her words.
{65663}{65732}Yes, she has a Napoleonic side.
{65741}{65815}She believes the world is rich...
{65803}{65903}and that one can cheat a little.
{65885}{65965}She begs God|to forgive her in advance.
{65953}{65991}She is sure that He will.
{66035}{66108}I'm afraid she'll leave us.
{66121}{66225}- Impossible!|- No, she has done it already.
{66219}{66316}It lasted 6 months.|I gave up hope.
{66299}{66367}She's ready to do it again.
{66384}{66454}She's not really my wife,Jim.
{66442}{66515}She has had three lovers.
{66503}{66636}One was a fling the day before|our wedding, to bury her youth.
{66612}{66694}And one as revenge|for something I did.
{66680}{66724}I don't know what.
{66773}{66832}I'm not the man she needs...
{66823}{66892}and she won't accept that.
{66897}{67008}I'm used to her|being unfaithful to me at times...
{67004}{67078}but I couldn't stand to see her go.
{67099}{67221}- But there's Albert.|- The singer who found the statue?
{67200}{67303}Yes, it was he who showed it to us.
{67286}{67331}He was wounded in the war.
{67325}{67415}He's convalescing|in a village near here.
{67411}{67511}Catherine encourages him|and gives him hope.
{67511}{67611}He has spoken about her to me.
{67593}{67670}He wants to marry her|and take the child.
{67683}{67752}I hold no grudge against him.
{67740}{67807}I have nothing against him nor her.
{67823}{67886}I am slowly renouncing her...
{67916}{67990}and all I had expected from the world.
{67989}{68102}That's what she likes about you.|That Buddhist side of yours.
{68107}{68183}She's usually kind and generous...
{68183}{68309}but when she thinks|she is not appreciated...
{68286}{68389}she becomes terrible, and suddenly|goes from one extreme to the other...
{68372}{68427}with sudden attacks.
{68468}{68540}Listen to that mole-cricket.
{68541}{68608}It's like a mole.
{68638}{68713}Jim could see the cottage|from his bedroom window.
{68702}{68805}Catherine was there,|a queen ready to flee.
{68786}{68838}Jim wasn't surprised.
{68830}{68918}He recalled"J"ules'mistakes|with other girls.
{68903}{68973}Catherine, he knew, was precise.
{68962}{69059}Jim felt sorry for"J"ules,|but he could not condemn her.
{69042}{69128}She jumped at men|the way she had jumped into the river.
{69113}{69175}The house was under a cloud.
{69192}{69251}Another week began.
{69408}{69550}- Time to go to bed, Sabine.|- Okay, Mommy.
{70058}{70171}I need to speak to you later,Jim.|Will you be free?
{70341}{70489}Words change meaning|from one language to another...
{70462}{70509}when they change gender.
{70503}{70651}In German, war and death are masculine,|unlike in French...
{70633}{70743}while sun and love are feminine.
{70846}{70924}- Life is neuter.|- Life is neuter?
{70911}{71003}Very pretty and very logical.
{71127}{71216}Skirts became short in France, too,|during the war.
{71201}{71280}Married soldiers hated that.
{71267}{71336}They felt betrayed...
{71325}{71416}but it was because|the fabric was scarce.
{71401}{71471}Yes, and women|cut their hair short...
{71459}{71543}to avoid danger in factories.
{71529}{71656}It's time you start to|appreciate German beer,Jim.
{71633}{71728}Jim is like me! He's French.|He couldn't care less about German beer.
{71711}{71767}- Not at all.|- What?
{71759}{71862}French wines are the best in Europe,|in the world even.
{71844}{71975}Look at the clarets:|Ch‚teau Lafite, Ch‚teau Margaux.
{72045}{72128}That's not all. There are others.
{72114}{72200}The burgundies: Romane, Chambertin...
{72185}{72262}Beaume, Pommard, Chablis, Volnais.
{72250}{72339}And Beaujolais wines:|Pouilly-FuissÈ...
{72324}{72419}Moulin ‡ Vent, Fleurie,|Morgon, Saint Amour.
{72404}{72541}We stared at the shell|as it rolled down the steps.
{72516}{72611}Three steps, two steps.|Lie down.
{72611}{72640}Catch me.
{73260}{73357}- What do you want to know?|- Nothing. I want to listen.
{73340}{73430}- To judge me?|- Certainly not.
{73482}{73586}I have nothing to tell you.|I want to question you.
{73587}{73671}The question is:|tell me aboutJim.
{73682}{73825}- Okay, but tell you what?|- Anything, but tell me point-blank.
{73810}{73875}Jim told of two young men|which he didn't name...
{73865}{73968}and told the story|of their friendship in Paris...
{73951}{74064}and how they met a certain girl.
{74043}{74186}He told of... Not that one,"J"im.|There, he had to say his own name.
{74160}{74239}He told of their friendship,|of their trip by the sea.
{74227}{74332}Catherine saw that"J"im remembered|everything about her.
{74314}{74399}She argued on a few points|and added other details.
{74384}{74504}He described their date, told her|how he perceived all three of them.
{74484}{74632}He said he always knew|that"J"ules could never keep Catherine.
{74624}{74716}- You'd have said that in the cafÈ?|- Yes.
{74719}{74808}- Go on.|- That's all there is.
{74808}{74850}There was the war...
{74863}{74948}my joy to seeJules again,|my seeing you at the station...
{74933}{75002}the happy days|I've spent with you here...
{75009}{75094}what I have seen, what I have learned,|what I have guessed...
{75080}{75183}that pending cloud, I mean Albert.
{75165}{75283}- Are you against me?|- No more than Jules is.
{75280}{75381}Let me tell|my side of the story now.
{75363}{75473}Jules conquered me|with his generosity...
{75454}{75535}his innocence, and his vulnerability.
{75522}{75596}He was such a contrast to other men.
{75602}{75697}I hoped to cure him|of his insecurities...
{75682}{75768}but I learned|they were part of him.
{75765}{75874}We were happy,|but our happiness did not last...
{75855}{76003}and we became two people, not one.
{76018}{76115}His family was torture for me.
{76098}{76171}At a reception before our wedding...
{76170}{76261}Jules' mother|offended me very deeply.
{76246}{76307}Jules said nothing.
{76298}{76446}I punished him by spending a few hours|with an old lover, Harold.
{76423}{76472}Yes, a lover.
{76466}{76600}So I was able to marryJules|with all accounts squared.
{76603}{76692}Luckily, his family moved away.
{76692}{76796}The war broke out.|Jules went to the Russian front.
{76796}{76912}He wrote me love letters,|wonderful letters.
{76904}{76993}I loved him more at a distance.|He became a saint again.
{76979}{77086}Things really went wrong|during his first leave.
{77068}{77143}I felt as if I was|in the arms of a stranger.
{77131}{77218}He left: Sabine was born|nine months later.
{77203}{77247}She doesn't look very much likeJules.
{77241}{77309}Believe what you want,|but she's his.
{77298}{77398}I said, "I've given you a child.|That's enough.
{77381}{77486}I want my own bedroom.|I want my own freedom. "
{77468}{77542}Remember our friend, Fortunio?
{77547}{77634}He was free. So was I.
{77619}{77721}He was a sweet partner.|What a vacation.
{77703}{77797}But he was too young to be serious.
{77798}{77852}One day, to my surprise...
{77859}{77966}I missed Jules and his indulgence.
{77948}{78039}My daughter attracted me|like a magnet.
{78024}{78067}I left.
{78073}{78133}I've been back for three months.
{78182}{78269}Jules is no longer my husband.
{78254}{78387}Don't feel sorry for him.|My presence alone satisfies him.
{78393}{78441}Then there is Albert.
{78435}{78556}He told me of that statue you loved|which resembles me.
{78535}{78579}I flirted with him.
{78572}{78684}He can be strange, but he has|a natural strength thatJules doesn't.
{78664}{78779}He wants to leave everything,|marry me and take me and my daughter.
{78759}{78831}So far, I like him. That's all.
{78819}{78905}He's coming to lunch tomorrow.|I'll see.
{78890}{78969}I talked more than you did.
{78956}{79043}I didn't say everything.|Neither did you.
{79028}{79092}Perhaps I've had other men.|That's my business.
{79083}{79165}I spoke only of what you mentioned.
{79151}{79227}- I understand.|- I don't want you to.
{79227}{79282}It's almost dawn.
{79288}{79394}Jim desired her,|but he kept repressing that desire.
{79376}{79492}She had to stay.|Was "J"im acting for"J"ules?
{79472}{79561}Or for himself?.|He would never know.
{79740}{79813}Perhaps she was seducing him,|although"J"im was unsure.
{79801}{79949}But she revealed her goals|only when she achieved them.
{80218}{80275}- Hello, Sabine.|- Hello, Albert.
{80266}{80372}- How are you? How is your mother?|- Fine.
{80546}{80588}Hello, Albert.
{80631}{80735}- You sacrificed your moustache?|- Yes, everyone did.
{80718}{80787}But I don't like it.|Now I feel naked.
{80775}{80822}I'll let it grow back.
{80816}{80887}Albert was wounded...
{80875}{80917}in the trenches.
{80911}{80978}I'm all right now,|but when I woke up...
{80967}{81077}and saw the doctors probing inside|my skull, I thought of Oscar Wilde.
{81059}{81123}God, spare me physical pain.
{81113}{81180}I'll take care of the moral pain.
{81169}{81232}What's revolting about war...
{81223}{81321}is that it deprives man|of his own individual battle.
{81303}{81437}Yes, but even in the midst of war,|he can fight it.
{81414}{81518}I knew a soldier in the hospital.
{81500}{81603}On leave, he met a girl on a train.
{81586}{81654}They talked between Nice and Marseilles.
{81643}{81730}She left and gave him her address.
{81715}{81837}Well, he wrote her every day|for two years from the trenches...
{81816}{81883}by candlelight, during battles.
{81872}{81958}His letters became more intimate.
{81943}{82083}At first, he wrote: "Dear Miss,"|and ended with, "Yours truly. "
{82058}{82164}Soon he called her "My little lamb"|and asked for her picture.
{82146}{82247}Then she became "My adorable lamb. "|First: "I kiss your hand. "
{82229}{82312}Then: "Your forehead. "
{82298}{82381}She sent him a picture...
{82367}{82458}and he wrote that he could see|her breasts through her robe.
{82443}{82552}He became more blunt.|"I love you terribly. "
{82534}{82647}He wrote to her mother|and proposed marriage.
{82626}{82748}He became her fiancÈ|without having seen her again.
{82727}{82844}As the war continued,|his letters became more intimate.
{82823}{82950}"I take you, my love.|I hold your adorable breasts.
{82927}{83012}I hold you naked against my body. "
{82998}{83118}She wrote a cold letter,|and he begged her to be serious...
{83097}{83181}for he could die at any time,|and he was right.
{83167}{83305}This mad affair|by correspondence could exist...
{83280}{83366}only in the violence|of trench warfare...
{83351}{83453}with death always nearby.
{83460}{83549}So this man fought the war...
{83534}{83638}but he fought|his own battle as well...
{83620}{83718}and he won a woman by mail.
{83729}{83818}He had a head wound, too,|when he arrived at the hospital...
{83803}{83862}but he was less lucky.
{83852}{83952}He died the day|before the Armistice.
{83959}{84046}In his last letter, he wrote her...
{84031}{84120}"Your breasts are|the only bombs I've loved. "
{84104}{84180}I'll show you some photos of him.
{84168}{84230}If you flip through them quickly,|he seems to be moving.
{84221}{84265}Pretty story.
{84260}{84345}Jules wrote me|beautiful letters too.
{84354}{84432}Hello, Albert.|Have you finished my song?
{84420}{84507}Let's go upstairs|and work on it together.
{85046}{85162}A rocking chair|has a rhythm of its own.
{85168}{85262}- What about the song?|- It's almost ready.
{85246}{85325}Yes. Let's go.
{85476}{85545}It's too good for them...
{85534}{85599}but we've no other audience.
{85711}{85799}She wore rings on every finger
{85784}{85861}More bracelets than I can tell
{85849}{85925}And she was the kind of singer
{85913}{85997}To put me under a spell
{85983}{86067}She had eyes, eyes of opal
{86052}{86123}They fascinated me
{86112}{86182}Her pale face was an oval
{86170}{86231}What a fatal femme fatale
{86300}{86367}We met with a kiss
{86356}{86424}A hit, then a miss
{86412}{86479}It wasn't all bliss
{86468}{86541}And we parted
{86529}{86599}We went our own ways
{86588}{86657}In life's whirlpool of days
{86645}{86716}I saw her again one night
{86705}{86779}Again she was an enchanted sight
{86842}{86921}I recognized her after a while
{86909}{86977}By her mysterious smile
{86965}{87033}Her face in an oval|Her eyes of opal
{87022}{87093}Affected me more than ever
{87081}{87151}I drank as I heard her sing
{87140}{87209}Alcohol lets time lose its sting
{87197}{87265}I drank far too much
{87254}{87328}I awoke to her touch
{87382}{87461}We met with a kiss
{87449}{87512}A hit, then a miss
{87502}{87569}It wasn't all bliss
{87558}{87629}But we started
{87618}{87688}We went our own ways
{87676}{87741}In life's whirlpool of days
{87731}{87798}Again I saw her one night
{87787}{87861}Again her smile was a light
{87932}{87991}When you kiss
{87982}{88044}Why miss
{88035}{88094}When you return
{88085}{88159}Why be stern
{88147}{88212}Together, we make our ways
{88202}{88265}In life's whirlpool of days
{88255}{88322}We go round and round
{88311}{88451}Together bound|Together bound
{88592}{88730}Each saw her in his own light.|She couldn't please them all.
{88706}{88815}Jim could only admire|Catherine alone.
{88796}{88870}He felt he was in the way.
{89249}{89306}- Good night.|- Good night.
{89327}{89451}Our affection is new. We should|let it rest like a newborn baby.
{89454}{89557}You were in love,Jim.|I can feel that.
{89540}{89626}- Why didn't you marry her?|- It didn't work out.
{89611}{89691}- What is she like?|- Quiet and patient.
{89678}{89771}Gilberte says she'll wait|for me forever.
{89756}{89815}You still love her,|and she loves you?
{89837}{89985}- Don't make her suffer.|- I need adventures and risks.
{89989}{90066}There's been a change too.
{90139}{90248}I admire you.|I enjoy seeing you.
{90230}{90328}- I'm afraid I'll forgetJules.|- You must not forget him.
{90311}{90353}Warn him.
{90545}{90589}Translate that!
{90583}{90716}The yearnings of two hearts|create such heavenly pain.
{90692}{90766}Not bad.
{90755}{90878}Though you added the heavenly.|Good night.
{90856}{90936}Give my regards to the others.
{90924}{91017}I'd like to read Goethe tonight.|May I have it?
{91001}{91096}- I lent it toJim.|- Too bad.
{91104}{91181}- Good night,Jim.|- Good night.
{91193}{91251}I'll bring it tomorrow.
{91651}{91726}You must bring it now.
{91714}{91778}She insists on reading it tonight.
{91797}{91886}Jim, she doesn't want me anymore.
{91897}{92000}I'm afraid she will disappear|from my life.
{91982}{92074}The last time I saw you with her...
{92058}{92126}you looked like a couple.
{92115}{92178}Love her, marry her...
{92169}{92229}and let me see her.
{92220}{92323}I mean, if you love her,|don't think I'm an obstacle.
{94090}{94159}Jim had waited for her all day.
{94148}{94219}She came into his arms gravely.
{94226}{94301}Their first kiss lasted all night.
{94289}{94360}They were silent|as they drew close.
{94348}{94406}Later, they remained silent.
{94397}{94500}Her face expressed|strange joy and curiosity.
{94482}{94539}Jim was prisoner.
{94530}{94596}No other woman existed for him.
{94685}{94727}Your turn.
{95208}{95303}I've asked Jim|to move into the house.
{95287}{95348}He'll take the small room.
{95470}{95531}Careful,Jim.
{95522}{95611}Be careful for both of you.
{96342}{96399}This is your room.
{96414}{96537}The books are in German,|but I've got others in my room.
{96571}{96665}I'll unpack your bag.|I think it will do.
{96674}{96765}The rest is a mess...
{96750}{96808}but we can't help that.
{96798}{96940}- What is on the other side?|- Sabine and Mathilde's room.
{97070}{97141}The bed isn't too bad.
{97129}{97194}Sit down next to me.
{97293}{97359}I've always liked|the nape of your neck.
{97349}{97458}That was the only part of you|I could look at without being seen.
{98101}{98154}What aboutJules?
{98146}{98205}He loves us both.
{98196}{98321}This won't surprise him.|He won't suffer.
{98299}{98388}We shall love him and respect him.
{98442}{98547}In the village they were|known as the three lunatics...
{98529}{98587}but they were accepted.
{98578}{98669}When she found that out, Catherine|invented a game.. the village idiot.
{98654}{98754}The village was the table.|They took turns as the idiot.
{98737}{98811}Sabine made them laugh.
{99572}{99669}Catherine believed|that love was short...
{99652}{99728}but constantly recurring.
{99716}{99777}Life was a vacation|for all of them.
{99768}{99869}Jules and"J"im|had never lived so intensely.
{99851}{99910}Time went by.
{99901}{99992}Happiness can't be told, but|it wears off without anyone noticing it.
{100017}{100089}One day, she decided|to seduce"J"ules.
{100077}{100136}While"J"im was reading downstairs...
{100128}{100194}she took "J"ules into her room.
{100184}{100280}Jules said no,|but Catherine said yes.
{100905}{101033}Jim said he wasn't jealous,|but he was.
{101009}{101123}She saw this and never|repeated the experiment.
{101136}{101202}One day, they walked around a lake...
{101192}{101287}hidden in the mist of a green valley.
{101271}{101332}The harmony between them was perfect.
{101323}{101436}Catherine had a headache,|so did"J"im.
{101416}{101509}If they had children, he thought,|they would be tall...
{101494}{101565}thin and have headaches too.
{101553}{101625}They played on the shore|of the lake.
{101613}{101737}She made him throw stones. She and|Jules learned how to skip stones.
{101739}{101798}The sky was so close to them.
{102057}{102130}Jim had to return to Paris.
{102118}{102175}His paper needed him.
{102166}{102269}But they knew he would return...
{102251}{102308}and things would remain the same.
{102299}{102418}Their perfect month|was engraved into them.
{102434}{102519}They waved at each other as he left.
{102504}{102639}Jules gave them his blessings|and promised to take care of her...
{102616}{102690}for they wanted to marry.
{102882}{102958}Jules is willing to divorce.
{102946}{103017}I'm going to marry Catherine.
{103005}{103081}I want to have children with her.
{103069}{103147}Jules will find me work|in his country.
{103135}{103258}Right now, I'm translating|an Austrian play.
{103289}{103346}Where are you going?
{103337}{103395}- Home.|- I'll go with you.
{103386}{103461}I'd rather you didn't.
{103571}{103629}Hello,Jim.
{103620}{103720}It's me, Therese.|The steam engine.
{103702}{103779}Therese, how are you?|How is...
{103767}{103843}It lasted two weeks.|I cheated on him.
{103831}{103925}He found out, got jealous,|stopped trusting me.
{103910}{103984}He locked me up for three weeks.
{103972}{104045}I was flattered, then furious.
{104033}{104102}I got out on a painter's ladder|with the painter.
{104090}{104166}I got impatient.|A guy wants to make me rich.
{104154}{104241}I follow him to Cairo|where he puts me up in a house.
{104299}{104370}An Englishman rescues me.
{104359}{104469}I move into his villa by the Red Sea,|play tennis, ride horses.
{104450}{104526}Then I get a letter.
{104514}{104592}- Hello, is Jules in Paris?|- No, he didn't come.
{104579}{104694}I go to wreck the wedding.|I marry him.
{104674}{104763}Hello,Jim. How is your buddy?
{104748}{104845}- Still with the same girl?|- Always.
{104829}{104916}He was serious.|He thought I wasn't.
{104901}{104976}My husband divorced me finally.
{104964}{105030}My undertaker married me.
{105020}{105083}It's a perfect marriage,|but no children.
{105074}{105210}I've neither time nor energy|to be unfaithful.
{105186}{105309}So I'm writing my memoirs for|the Sunday Times Magazine in Europe.
{105288}{105354}My husband.
{105399}{105463}- What about you,Jim?|- I'm getting married.
{105678}{105766}- How's Jules?|- All right.
{105807}{105911}Interesting, isn't she?|Her name is Denise.
{105893}{105965}She won't talk to you.
{105954}{106040}She never talks.|She's not stupid.
{106025}{106133}She's empty.|It's all empty in there.
{106114}{106190}- She's a thing.|- Pretty thing.
{106178}{106265}Yes, beautiful. It's just sex.
{106250}{106307}Pure sex.
{106333}{106430}- Say good-bye, Denise.|- Sir.
{106526}{106605}Catherine spent the winter at home|in front of the fireplace.
{106592}{106668}She was "J"im's fiancÈe,|on loan to"J"ules.
{106656}{106713}Every day she asked"J"ules...
{106704}{106763}"Do you think "J"im loves me?"
{106797}{106869}Listen to me, Gilberte.
{106857}{106942}If Catherine wants something...
{106927}{107013}and she thinks|no one will be hurt...
{106999}{107077}she may be wrong,|but she'll do it...
{107064}{107138}to learn from the experience.
{107126}{107211}It's her way of achieving wisdom.
{107196}{107258}That can last a long time.
{107249}{107306}Don't be mean.
{107321}{107399}I'm not mean. I'm jealous.
{107427}{107513}I knew it would end this way.
{107545}{107616}Don't leave tomorrow.
{107604}{107703}You'll give her your life,|so just give me one more week.
{107710}{107809}Jim couldn't leave Gilberte.|Catherine couldn't leave"J"ules.
{107792}{107866}They couldn't hurt|Jules or Gilberte...
{107853}{107959}who belonged to the past|and who each played the same role.
{107941}{108067}"TellJules I saw Therese.|She's married and is writing.
{108045}{108110}I have to delay|my trip back once again...
{108101}{108177}but soon I'll be free,|ready for you.
{108165}{108254}I must still say a few good-byes.
{108268}{108334}A few good-byes. "
{108394}{108454}Do you thinkJim loves me?
{108546}{108637}- Hello,Jules.|- Hello.
{108622}{108676}What's wrong?
{108667}{108752}Why didn't Catherine|come to meet me?
{108738}{108862}She disliked your letters. You talked|about your work, your good-byes.
{108840}{108943}She didn't like your absence.|You were gone too long.
{108926}{109009}When she is in doubt,|she can do anything.
{108995}{109105}- Is she waiting for us?|- Yes, I think so.
{109785}{109857}I didn't want to tell you.
{109845}{109953}She left yesterday morning|without saying a word.
{109935}{110043}I had hoped that she would|be back before your arrival.
{110025}{110084}Aren't you worried?
{110075}{110171}You mean, is she in danger?
{110238}{110342}She is merely doing|something irreparable.
{110349}{110444}I told you,|she disliked your letters.
{110428}{110502}"Therese is married|and has become a writer.
{110490}{110549}I must say a few good-byes. "
{110565}{110702}No, Catherine never|does anything halfway.
{110678}{110796}She's an irresistible force|that can't be stopped.
{110775}{110864}Her harmony is never|shaken because...
{110849}{110924}she knows she is always innocent.
{110912}{111020}- You speak of her as if she was a queen.|- She is a queen.
{111020}{111085}Let me be frank.
{111075}{111193}She's not especially beautiful|or intelligent or sincere...
{111172}{111231}but she is a real woman.
{111222}{111285}And that is why we love her...
{111275}{111343}and all men desire her.
{111379}{111480}Despite this,|why did she make us a gift...
{111463}{111526}of her presence?
{111516}{111630}Because we treated her|like a queen.
{111610}{111699}You know, I almost stayed in Paris.
{111683}{111767}I knew it could never last.
{111777}{111866}Even our friendship suffers.
{111852}{111934}At times, I'm jealous|of your years with her.
{111920}{112001}And I hate you|for not being jealous of me.
{111988}{112053}Do you believe that?
{112044}{112173}I'll do anything|not to lose her completely.
{112149}{112216}You will, too, when she returns...
{112206}{112264}for she always returns.
{112255}{112358}Listen, I'm going back to Paris.
{112340}{112429}Tell her you didn't see me|at the station.
{112414}{112483}It's the only solution.
{112529}{112665}I see. I met the train,|but you weren't on it.
{112853}{112954}Hello. What's the matter?
{113089}{113146}You've just arrived.
{113179}{113289}You're mine and I'm yours.|All is well.
{113270}{113346}But in your letters,|you said you had things to do.
{113334}{113439}So did I.|You said good-bye to your loves.
{113422}{113504}I decided to say good-bye to mine.
{113490}{113608}You'll hold me in your arms|all night long, but that's all.
{113588}{113681}We want a child, don't we?
{113666}{113789}Well, if I had one now,|I wouldn't know if it was yours.
{113767}{113824}Do you understand?
{113840}{113932}- I had to do it.|- Do you love Albert?
{113917}{113991}- No.|- Does he love you?
{113979}{114150}Yes. You must believe me.|It was your only chance.
{114119}{114207}Albert equals Gilberte.
{114192}{114255}You don't say anything?
{114245}{114315}We must start with a clean slate.
{114304}{114433}A clean slate and no debts.|That was her creed.
{114409}{114483}And nothing happened.
{114472}{114565}She slept,|but"J"im's eyes remained open.
{114549}{114671}He realized that they were|being drawn together.
{114650}{114756}So they started all over again,|flying high like birds of prey.
{114738}{114874}They restrained until she was sure|she didn't bear Albert's child.
{114850}{114963}This restraint exalted them.|They were always together.
{114943}{115022}They never cheated.|The promised land was in view.
{115101}{115171}And The Promised Land Faded
{115160}{115303}They realized that Catherine|was not pregnant with their child.
{115277}{115357}They saw a specialist who told them|that this was not uncommon...
{115344}{115418}and that these things took time|with most couples.
{115578}{115635}What's wrong?
{115626}{115691}I want to sleep alone tonight.|Go to your room.
{115682}{115757}- Why?|- I just want to.
{115745}{115829}- Explain.|- There's nothing to explain.
{115814}{115889}I'll just stay with you.|That's all.
{115878}{115936}That's not true.
{115927}{116029}I don't want you to stay.|I'm disgusted.
{116011}{116069}It's a nightmare|when the night comes.
{116059}{116159}When I think of that child we will|never have, I feel I'm taking a test.
{116142}{116248}- I can't stand it.|- Our love is all that counts.
{116230}{116304}No, because I count too...
{116291}{116360}and I love you less.
{116349}{116425}Let's stay away from each other.
{116413}{116520}I may still love you,|but I'll run that risk.
{116502}{116612}Go to Gilberte|since she writes you every day.
{116593}{116739}- You are not fair.|- I know, but I'm heartless.
{116712}{116833}That's why I don't love you|and why I'll never love anyone.
{116812}{116886}Besides, I'm 32, and you are 29.
{116875}{116992}When I'm 40,|you'll want a girl of 25...
{116971}{117054}and I'll be left alone|like a fool.
{117070}{117184}You may be right.|I'll leave for three months.
{117202}{117268}Are you hurt?
{117258}{117322}I'm not anymore.
{117313}{117387}We should never be hurt|both at once.
{117374}{117474}When you stop suffering,|I'll start.
{117617}{117677}Am I disturbing you?
{117824}{117889}I can't stand it.
{117879}{118004}- Did you hear us arguing?|- No, I was working.
{117982}{118083}I can't stand him.|I'm going mad.
{118066}{118146}I'm glad he's going tomorrow.|Good riddance.
{118133}{118205}Don't be unfair.
{118193}{118251}You know he loves you.
{118242}{118344}I really don't know anymore.
{118352}{118409}He lied to me.
{118400}{118501}He didn't drop Gilberte. He doesn't|even know what he wants himself.
{118483}{118601}I love her. I don't love her,|but I will, maybe.
{118613}{118709}I can't help it|if we didn't have a child.
{118693}{118797}- Got a cigarette?|- You want one?
{119048}{119151}- Want me to talk to him?|- No, please don't.
{119133}{119219}I'm half for him|and half against him.
{119204}{119278}But I want him to go.
{119266}{119361}We've decided to separate|for three months.
{119345}{119403}What do you think?
{119418}{119507}I don't know.|It may be a good idea.
{119493}{119563}You won't say what you think.
{119575}{119632}I know you despise me.
{119670}{119786}No, I shall never despise you.
{119838}{119902}I shall always love you...
{119893}{119985}no matter what you do,|no matter what happens.
{119989}{120046}Is that true?
{120127}{120190}I love you too.
{120274}{120363}We were happy, weren't we?
{120349}{120408}But we are happy.
{120398}{120507}I mean, I am.
{120489}{120549}Is that true?
{120573}{120683}Yes, let's always stay together...
{120688}{120777}like an old couple,|with Sabine...
{120762}{120832}and our grandchildren.
{120963}{121021}Stay near me.
{121041}{121144}I don't want to see him|before he goes.
{121126}{121199}Then stay here.
{121187}{121266}I'll sleep downstairs.
{121626}{121684}My little Catherine.
{121703}{121776}Often you remind me...
{121789}{121909}of a Chinese play I saw|before the war.
{121888}{121973}The curtain rises|and the emperor...
{121958}{122051}turns to the audience and says...
{122065}{122162}"I am the unhappiest man on Earth...
{122145}{122218}because I have two wives.
{122206}{122311}My first wife and my second wife. "
{122907}{123030}Their love was now relative,|but to"J"ules it was absolute.
{123050}{123111}The next morning|Jim left the house.
{123102}{123176}Catherine took him to the station.
{123164}{123241}A mist settled over the valley.
{123229}{123349}The hive felt that"J"im|has lost favor with its queen.
{123328}{123385}He had to go.
{124026}{124096}We can't see the house.
{124266}{124351}The railway schedule had been changed.
{124337}{124402}The train left the next day.
{124571}{124659}One always feels guilty|in a hotel room.
{124644}{124762}I'm not very moral,|but I dislike it.
{124741}{124828}Don't tell me you don't.|I wouldn't believe you.
{125088}{125174}Jim thought of their children.
{125159}{125250}He imagined a houseful|of beautiful children.
{125235}{125314}He knew that if they had none...
{125302}{125360}Catherine would have affairs again.
{125375}{125462}They were silent in the gloomy|hotel room, but they made love.
{125447}{125569}They didn't know why. Maybe|it was their way to end their story.
{125547}{125667}It was like a funeral|and as if they were already dead.
{126104}{126232}The next day she took him|to his train, but they did not wave.
{126210}{126316}They separated,|though nothing forced them.
{126298}{126397}It's all over now,|Jim told himself once again.
{126885}{127011}- Your medicine and a letter.|- Thanks.
{127100}{127196}I think I'm pregnant.|Come. Catherine.
{127180}{127267}Gilberte, please give me|some writing paper.
{127252}{127343}Catherine, I am in bed|and very ill.
{127328}{127419}Besides, I doubt|that your child is mine.
{127404}{127536}One night could not succeed|where love failed.
{127512}{127623}"Where love failed. "
{127604}{127714}You are right.|That illness is a joke.
{127695}{127802}I'll write and say|you want to see him.
{127784}{127909}Dear Hypochondriac,|come as soon as you can.
{127887}{127955}Catherine awaits a letter.
{127945}{128017}Write in big letters|for her eyes are tired...
{128005}{128109}and she cannot read|small handwriting.
{128130}{128200}She doesn't think I was ill.
{128188}{128246}I don't think she is pregnant.
{128237}{128308}In any case,|I doubt that I'm the father.
{128296}{128355}I've got reasons to doubt.
{128346}{128420}Our past, Albert and the rest.
{128408}{128495}Since you're going out,|could you mail this letter?
{128480}{128522}Certainly.
{128732}{128806}Oh, there's a letter for you.
{128829}{128903}I'm late. See you later.
{128980}{129030}I love you,Jim.
{129023}{129139}So many unbelievable things|turn out to be true.
{129118}{129177}I'm going to have a child.
{129168}{129318}Let us thank God,Jim.|I am sure you are the father.
{129291}{129414}I beg you to believe me.|Your love is now alive within me.
{129393}{129462}You must believe me.
{129450}{129523}This paper is your skin.|This ink is my blood.
{129511}{129603}I'm pressing on my pen.|Please, answer me.
{129955}{130059}Darling, I believe you.|I am going to you.
{130042}{130131}All that is good within me|comes from you.
{130143}{130217}They had promised|never to call each other.
{130205}{130276}They couldn't talk|if they couldn't touch each other.
{130264}{130358}The mail took three days.|Their letters crossed.
{130343}{130497}I've got reasons to doubt.|Our past, Albert and the rest.
{130469}{130554}I will stop thinking of you,|so that you can stop thinking of me.
{130540}{130629}You disgust me, but that is wrong.
{130614}{130675}Nothing should ever be disgusting.
{130756}{130827}My"J"im,your long letter|changes everything.
{130816}{130937}In two days you'll be here.|Not a letter, but you.
{130916}{131024}Let's forget our differences.|They are gone.
{131005}{131125}Come back to me soon,|even late at night.
{131105}{131166}At last,"J"im received|a letter from "J"ules.
{131182}{131279}"Your child died|before it could be born.
{131263}{131334}To Catherine, you died with it. "
{131346}{131412}They had created nothing.
{131402}{131502}Jim thought,|new laws are beautiful...
{131485}{131593}but it's more practical|to obey old ones.
{131574}{131647}We played with life and lost.
{132019}{132076}I don't believe it.
{132067}{132134}- You gave up your cottage?|- Yes.
{132124}{132183}We're living in France now.
{132174}{132260}We've rented an old mill|on the Seine.
{132246}{132357}We must see each other.|Drop in tomorrow.
{132380}{132439}Please tell me about Catherine.
{132431}{132516}For a long time,|I feared she'd commit suicide.
{132501}{132566}She had bought a gun.
{132556}{132647}She would say,|"So-and-so killed himself'...
{132632}{132740}like others say,|"So-and-so died of cholera. "
{132722}{132852}She seemed to be in mourning.|She looked like she'd been ill.
{132828}{132972}She moved in slow motion|with a dead smile on her face.
{132987}{133049}Gilberte, this is my friend Jules.
{133072}{133225}Jim has told me so much about you.|I feel like I know you.
{133299}{133359}Does Catherine know|you've come to see me?
{133350}{133446}Yes. She's inviting you|for a ride in her car.
{133430}{133510}I'd like you|and maybe your wife to come.
{133497}{133630}- She won't accept, but I will.|- I've got to go now.
{133640}{133744}No,Jules! You can't wear a hat|like that, at least not in France.
{133726}{133800}Here. Take mine.
{133880}{133952}- Hello.|- Hi.
{133940}{134002}Come. It's over there.
{134304}{134368}She's in a good mood today.
{134358}{134416}Don't jar her.
{134445}{134502}Your place is beautiful.
{134493}{134578}Look at her car.
{134774}{134816}It's Jim.
{135177}{135281}Catherine smiled,|but she looked mysterious.
{135264}{135397}She took her white pajamas|and wrapped them in a neat parcel.
{135402}{135487}Jim wondered why|and then forgot about it.
{135472}{135537}They went for a drive.
{136345}{136419}I'm hungry. Let's eat here.
{137114}{137181}Albert, what are you doing here?
{137171}{137228}Getting some fresh air.
{137276}{137350}Besides, I live here.
{137339}{137425}- Will you eat with us?|- Sure, if we eat now.
{137410}{137503}- You got a date?|- Perhaps.
{137978}{138082}Please give me my parcel.|Good night.
{138297}{138384}She's done it again.
{138369}{138426}I didn't expect it.
{138417}{138507}I thought she'd use|a new leading man.
{138492}{138600}- Albert is an old story.|- He was perfect for tonight.
{138581}{138654}Leave her the car.
{138642}{138782}She thinks that in a couple, at least|only one person needs to be faithful.
{138758}{138858}- The other-|- I must go home.
{138840}{138915}You saw that I'm not living alone.
{138903}{139001}- I'm going to marry Gilberte.|- You're wiser than I am.
{138985}{139097}You've realized that when it's over|with Catherine, it's all over.
{139078}{139153}Gilberte will make a good wife.
{139141}{139198}She's very beautiful.
{139441}{139538}Jim recognized Catherine's car.
{139522}{139603}First he saw nothing.
{139590}{139708}Then he saw the car|weaving on the empty square...
{139687}{139790}like a riderless horse,|like a ghost ship.
{140461}{140562}What a night.|I made a mistake.
{140544}{140629}That life was dead for me.
{140614}{140685}It was a desert,Jim.
{140673}{140745}I kept looking for you.
{140733}{140797}Then come right away.
{141147}{141262}Lie down next to me.|Kiss me.
{141242}{141339}There's something I must tell you.
{141322}{141364}Say it.
{141470}{141580}I found a passage|you had marked in a book.
{141586}{141650}"On a ship, a woman made love...
{141640}{141742}to a stranger in her mind. "
{141724}{141803}It struck me as a confession.
{141791}{141879}That's how you explore the universe.
{141863}{141937}I feel that curiosity too.
{141926}{141984}Perhaps everyone does.
{141975}{142082}I overcome it for your sake,|but you don't.
{142102}{142165}In love, I agree with you...
{142155}{142229}a couple is not ideal.
{142251}{142340}Just look around you.
{142325}{142399}You wanted something better...
{142387}{142461}by refusing to submit|to hypocrisy.
{142474}{142580}You wanted to invent love.
{142595}{142701}But pioneers must be|humble and unselfish.
{142683}{142773}Let's face it.
{142758}{142860}We have failed in everything.
{142898}{142964}You tried to change me.
{142984}{143091}I tried to spread joy,|but I've created only pain.
{143115}{143213}I promised to marry Gilberte...
{143197}{143286}but I can't postpone|my promise endlessly.
{143270}{143338}It's counterfeit.
{143328}{143421}I've no longer any hope|of marrying you.
{143406}{143523}Catherine, I am going|to marry Gilberte.
{143502}{143579}We can still have children.
{143590}{143670}How touching.
{143701}{143819}What about me?|What about me?
{143836}{143916}What about the children I wanted?
{143903}{143998}- You didn't want any.|- I did.
{144053}{144129}They would have been beautiful.
{144345}{144403}You are going to die.
{144394}{144482}You disgust me,Jim.|I'm going to kill you.
{144591}{144673}You're a coward. You're scared.
{146563}{146714}Jim was glad to see"J"ules|and to see that Catherine left him cold.
{146687}{146782}She tried not to leave them alone|and suggested a ride.
{146766}{146830}Jim agreed.|But where to?
{146844}{146966}Catherine drove fast|and carelessly.
{146945}{147092}Something was in the air,|just like the day they met Albert.
{147065}{147168}They stopped in a cafÈ by a pond.
{147150}{147281}- Now they're burning books.|- It's unbelievable.
{147428}{147530}Catherine found|you were easy to get...
{147512}{147577}and hard to keep.
{147567}{147677}Your love vanished and returned...
{147658}{147738}with hers.
{147725}{147829}I never knew those ups and downs.
{147812}{147895}Mr. Jim, I've something to tell you.
{147881}{147941}Will you come with me?
{148065}{148127}Watch us,Jules.
{148726}{148803}Jules would no longer dread,|as he had from the beginning...
{148791}{148855}her unfaithfulness|and that he might lose her...
{148845}{148904}since she was gone now.
{148895}{148969}Their bodies were found|in the river.
{148957}{149020}Jim's coffin was huge.
{149011}{149076}It dwarfed Catherine's.
{149066}{149178}They left nothing of themselves.|But"J"ules had his daughter.
{149184}{149279}Did Catherine merely|seek excitement? No.
{149264}{149331}But she had dazed"J"ules.
{149320}{149389}He was overcome with relief.
{149460}{149552}The friendship of"J"ules and"J"im|had no equivalent in love.
{149536}{149601}They enjoyed little things together.
{149592}{149666}They accepted their differences|with tenderness.
{149654}{149780}Everyone called them|Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.
{151315}{151419}The ashes were placed in an urn.
{151425}{151490}Jules might have mixed them.
{151480}{151590}Catherine wanted hers|to be cast to the wind...
{151572}{151644}but that was not permitted.
1
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:43,594
THE GREEN ROOM

2
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,247
The history of the green room

3
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:06,535
unfolds in
a small city in the East of France.

4
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,543
It starts 10 years after
the end of the 1st World War

5
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,460
which caused millions of deaths.

6
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,378
Good morning lady,
I come to see Mr. Mazet

7
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:24,205
- Gerard Mazet
- Come in, sir. Follow me, please.

8
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:37,921
- Gerard
- No, Julien, don't go and see her.

9
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,716
I prefer you keep
the memory of Genevieve,

10
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,046
of when she was alive,
of when she smiled.

11
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,780
I want to be with you, Gerard.

12
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:53,785
No, no, I don't want that!

13
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:58,356
Stop that! Get out of here!

14
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:01,795
Genevieve, Genevieve

15
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:07,988
Mortem nostra sua morte
devicit Christus.

16
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,273
Death is only a transitory
state, my son, for the baptized.

17
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,879
Sin entered the world
through the first man, Adam,

18
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:18,784
and with sin, death.

19
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,251
With his death,
Jesus saved us from sin,

20
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:24,413
and so, saved us from death
which is the daughter of sin.

21
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:28,514
His wife is not dead,
my son, because she was baptized,

22
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:30,165
washed of original sin.

23
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,399
She has not died, she's only sleeping,

24
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,598
incorruptible.

25
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:38,361
And she'll be like that
until the end of times.

26
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,637
Until the day she wakes up and you

27
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,109
wake up with her to appear

28
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,535
in front of our Father and our Judge.

29
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:50,559
In the meanwhile,
pray my son. Pray and wait.

30
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,310
Purify yourself,
to be worthy of reuniting with her

31
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:57,214
on the day of Resurrection
and the Glory of the Lord.

32
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:59,909
Reunite with her on Resurrection day.

33
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:02,508
But when will
that day arrive? When, when?

34
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:06,367
Patience, my son.
Patience and hope.

35
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,260
No! It's not possible that she died!

36
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:20,465
Genevieve!

37
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:26,529
Leave me. All of you!

38
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,731
- Gerard, don't do that!
- I want to die!

39
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:29,880
Take care of him.

40
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:33,496
It's your fault,
Mr. priest. Yes, your fault.

41
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,314
This woman did not die because of sin,

42
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:36,350
she died of pneumonia.

43
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,538
Your words of resignation
are of no use to her husband.

44
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,598
Those who weep
for their dead, it's not in 20 years,

45
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,795
nor in a thousand that they hope
to see them again, but right now.

46
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,439
All that they expect
from you is that you say:

47
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:47,632
get up and walk!
And that the dead get up.

48
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,199
And if you are
incapable of resurrecting Genevieve

49
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:53,377
today, right now,
there's nothing for you to do here.

50
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:54,985
So get out. Out!

51
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:14,986
I promised myself
to be strong. I wanted to resist.

52
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,853
And Mazet will resist...

53
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,883
only if he doesn't have to
listen to conventional consolations.

54
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:27,889
Yes, I know what you are feeling.

55
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:30,818
You'd have liked to be dead in her
place, or at the same time as her,

56
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:36,178
but it depends only on you
that Genevieve stays alive.

57
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,779
How can you say that? How do you know?

58
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,083
Your story is exactly like mine, Mazet.

59
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:42,563
My wife died 11 years ago,

60
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:44,008
a few months after our marriage,

61
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:45,591
on a trip to Italy.

62
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:48,055
Like you,
I thought that I couldn't live.

63
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,296
Around me I heard
only stupid words of resignation.

64
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,847
Like you, I wanted to die.

65
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:57,085
And how did you find
the courage to continue without her?

66
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,188
I decided that
even if she had died for the others,

67
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,078
for me she will always be alive.

68
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,118
Listen Mazet,
I'll tell you something important.

69
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,287
For those who don't care,

70
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,239
Genevieve's eyes are closed.

71
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,307
Nut for you they will always be open.

72
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,396
Don't think you've lost her.

73
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:27,450
Think that now
you cannot lose her any more.

74
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:29,972
Dedicate all your thoughts to her,

75
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,510
all your activities, all your love,

76
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,851
and you'll see
that the dead belong to us,

77
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:36,951
if we accept to belong to them.

78
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:38,679
Believe me, Gerard,

79
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,493
our dead can go on living.

80
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,484
Are you looking for something, sir?

81
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,977
Yes, Iíd like to know

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,035
whether in the auction
of the day after tomorrow,

83
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,935
in the belongings
of the Vallance family,

84
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,298
there are any antique jewels.

85
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,650
I don't know,
the secretary can inform you.

86
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,082
Good morning, sir.

87
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,945
I think I understood
you are looking for some object.

88
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,765
Yes, I'm looking for an old ring
that belonged to the Vallance family.

89
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,983
Almost all things in here
belong to the Vallance family.

90
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:59,880
Could you describe me that ring?

91
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,355
It's a silver ring,
shaped like an eight,

92
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,670
with two amethysts inside of the curl.

93
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:10,813
It's not here because the jewels
will be auctioned another day.

94
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:14,672
But if I see that ring
I'll keep it apart for one day,

95
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:18,128
so that you can
identify it before the auction.

96
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:21,055
- Thank you very much.
- No problem at all.

97
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,318
I never saw you here.
You're not an auction regular?

98
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:27,545
No. To tell the truth,
I don't like them at all.

99
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,038
Especially if I knew
the owners of the objects on sale.

100
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,907
I feel like
being at some kind of pillage.

101
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:37,463
For instance,
this clock and these adornments,

102
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:40,346
who can guarantee us
that they will not be dispersed

103
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,731
If I could I wouldn't
be opposed to this kind of thing.

104
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:45,569
I understand, but
that wouldn't resurrect the dead.

105
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,653
- Do you really believe that?
- I don't know.

106
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,153
You can call it
professional deformation,

107
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,234
but I only like old objects

108
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,048
that have belonged to somebody.

109
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,250
I detest new objects,
that's why I'm working here.

110
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:00,608
Where can I find you if I find the ring?

111
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,772
At the Globe newspaper, I work there.

112
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,515
- The Globe still exists?
- Yes.

113
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,504
I thought that that paper
had disappeared some time ago.

114
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,166
I used to glance through
the collections in my uncle's attic.

115
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:13,614
OK, I think the only thing
left for me is to say thank you.

116
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,273
Wait with that until I find your ring.

117
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:19,581
I know what you're thinking.

118
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:24,031
That you've seen this somewhere.
They're Napolitan marionettes.

119
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,468
They're very pretty.
Alright, thank you miss.

120
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:27,997
Good afternoon, sir.

121
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,364
It's him, go open the door.

122
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:02,415
Hello, Georges.

123
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:16,543
Sir, the boy has
repaired the projector,

124
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,359
but you'd better inspect it.

125
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:20,015
You are right, Mrs. Rambaud.

126
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:28,356
Come here Georges.

127
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:36,152
OK.

128
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:39,946
You've repaired it very well.
Here, take these plates.

129
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,578
OK Georges, turn it on.

130
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,253
Let's see the first plate.

131
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,196
You know the dragonfly, don't you?

132
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,802
Put another plate.

133
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,508
Yes, you're right,
it's the other way around.

134
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,231
Careful with your fingers.

135
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:26,541
Flees, big flees. They're well drawn.

136
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:28,295
Do you like it?

137
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,328
No, insects don't interest you. Wait.

138
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,258
Wait.

139
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:41,502
I just bought them.

140
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:46,037
Look, theyíre very nice. You'll see.

141
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,958
They are wounded soldiers,
perhaps they are dead.

142
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,759
Yes, in the sand,
they fell to the ground.

143
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:08,920
Put this other one.

144
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,260
The church was bombed.

145
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:27,173
Yes, they brought the wounded
to the church to protect them.

146
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,854
And this one, a howitzer
probably cut off his head.

147
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,028
Look, Georges,
it's a dead soldier hanging in a tree.

148
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,579
He's hanging because of an explosion.

149
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:58,269
Don't you have anything else
to show him than these horrors?

150
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,820
They are not for his age.

151
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:02,462
You're right,
Mrs. Rimbaud. Let's have supper.

152
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,711
Really, I don't understand your denial.

153
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,812
I'm offering you a unique opportunity.

154
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,313
What's more,
you'd work in Paris with me.

155
00:14:20,348 --> 00:14:24,449
I don't like Paris, I'm a provincial.

156
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:27,975
But you wouldn't like
to work for a real paper?

157
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,352
A weekly, at the heart of events.

158
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:35,987
I feel flattered that you thought of me.

159
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:39,903
But I like the Globe,
so that if you have to sell it,

160
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:43,147
sell me with it,
with the files and the furniture.

161
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,336
But what if nobody would buy The Globe.

162
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:48,443
Come here, I'll show you something.

163
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:01,659
Those are the issues that are
returned in the mail every month.

164
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,461
Read it yourself. Subscriber deceased.

165
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:10,269
Return to sender.
Subscriber deceased... deceased.

166
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:15,133
It shouldn't be
for me to tell you, you are young.

167
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:18,378
All our subscribers are old.

168
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:21,422
Each of these issues
represents a dead reader.

169
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:24,239
Yes, I didn't know
how to explain to you before

170
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:25,977
the reasons why
I don't want to go to Paris.

171
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,515
You just gave them to me yourself.

172
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,790
I want to stay here, for them.

173
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,139
- Miss.
- Good afternoon.

174
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:46,042
I think we found
the ring you were looking for.

175
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,479
- Ah, great!
- I'll be with you in a minute.

176
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,557
OK, thanks a lot.

177
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:54,776
- Miss, can I go?
- Sure, Gustav.

178
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:59,638
- See you, Ms. Mandel
- Bye bye, Gustav.

179
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,561
- Your name is Mandel?
- Yes.

180
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:03,341
Can I ask you your first name?

181
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:04,985
Cecilia.

182
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,185
But it's much easier
if you remember my parents.

183
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,332
Wasn't your father's name Julien?

184
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,955
Yes, he died quite a while ago,

185
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:17,543
but his name was Julien, like yours.

186
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:21,246
So, why didn't you
tell me the other day

187
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,917
that we've seen each other before.

188
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:26,870
I didn't want to bother you.

189
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,300
And also it's very logical
that you don't remember me.

190
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:33,982
I have good memories of our meeting.

191
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,663
I was a teenager, shy with people.

192
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:38,330
Really, everything made me afraid.

193
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,948
But you talked to me as to an adult,

194
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:42,007
without irony.

195
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,064
Now I remember that meeting.

196
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:48,086
It'll be about 11 years ago, in Rome.

197
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:52,727
There was a big storm and
we sought shelter with your father

198
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,023
and his friends in a ditch
opened by archaeologists.

199
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,927
It was at Caesar's palace.
You see, everything's engraved.

200
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:01,186
Not at all.

201
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,411
It wasn't in Rome, but in Naples.

202
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:06,859
I wasn't 11 years ago, but 14.

203
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:10,373
It's true there was
a storm, but that was in Pompeii.

204
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:13,430
And it wasn't my father,
I was with my father's brother.

205
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,838
- my uncle Henry.
- I mixed it all up.

206
00:17:16,873 --> 00:17:19,542
So many things have happened since then.

207
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,619
There's been a war,
bad and cruel things.

208
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:24,963
But two years after our meeting,

209
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,652
I was convinced that I'd see again

210
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,781
the man
who had talked to me like to an adult.

211
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:32,686
And I had
a profound reason for thinking that.

212
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:41,985
You're impatient to see your ring
and I will give it to you.

213
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,481
Yes, excuse me.

214
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,163
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

215
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,743
It will have to
follow the due course of the auction.

216
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:51,010
It will have
a starting price of 100 francs.

217
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,884
You can tell me
how high you are willing to bid.

218
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,926
I thought to go until 300 francs.

219
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,312
Do you think that will be sufficient?

220
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:59,751
Yes, it's very nice but
I don't think they will bid much higher.

221
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:02,303
I promise nothing, but I'll look
for you during the auction.

222
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,427
I prefer not to be
at the auction, it's painful for me.

223
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,881
I understand. So tell
the person who represents you

224
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,073
to make himself known
before the auction.

225
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,230
Mrs. Rambaud will come, my housekeeper.

226
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,394
Very well.

227
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:19,085
- Could I see the ring again?
- Of course.

228
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:37,527
Yes sir?

229
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,320
I'm going to dictate some letters.

230
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:52,412
Tell me, what do they
think of Davenne here?

231
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,429
What did you say, sir?
What do you want to know?

232
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:58,095
Ah, at ease. I'm not
asking anything indiscreet.

233
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,106
I only asked you

234
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,060
what the colleagues think of Davenne.

235
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:06,329
Mr. Davenne is a bit special.

236
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:08,815
He talks little and
nobody sees him in town.

237
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,112
They think that he
must have suffered a lot,

238
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:13,300
with the loss of
so many friends in the war,

239
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,078
while he himself was not even wounded.

240
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,658
I think he was in an
anti-aircraft unit, but in artillery.

241
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:21,080
Yes. They were
very close to the front.

242
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:22,207
They didn't kill many enemies,

243
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:26,197
but the Germans feared them
and couldn't localize them.

244
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,893
That's why no one of them was wounded.

245
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:32,632
Do you believe Davenne
blames himself because of that?

246
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,093
It's possible.

247
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:38,547
There are few men here
of Davenne's generation...

248
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:40,679
who still have both of their legs.

249
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,391
Anyway, he's a strange one!

250
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:46,196
My impression is that he voluntarily

251
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:49,539
decided to eschew
all the good things of life.

252
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:51,566
Some people don't like him.

253
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,559
They find him distant.

254
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,160
I think that he never recovered...

255
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,588
from the death of his wife.

256
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:58,519
They got engaged just before the war.

257
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:01,758
She waited 4 years for him,
and then the were newly wedded,

258
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:03,631
when it happened, when she died.

259
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,804
After that he was not the same any more.

260
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,222
But I think Mr. Davenne isn't a bad guy.

261
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:10,344
When I say he fails
in all that he embarks on,

262
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:14,647
I'm unjust, because he's
a virtuoso in the obituary columns.

263
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,955
When I think that in the past year

264
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:19,228
he wrote 31 articles about dead persons,

265
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:22,226
without ever using
the same expression twice.

266
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,780
I'm looking at you!

267
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:47,877
You still here?

268
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,613
Go on, go.

269
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:56,778
We start at 10 francs. 10, 20, 30...

270
00:20:56,813 --> 00:21:00,452
40, 50, 60 on the left.

271
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:03,748
70, 80 on the back, 90 on the left.

272
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:05,759
We are at 90.

273
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,735
90 once, twice, 90 thrice.

274
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,291
Awarded for 90 francs
to the lady on the left.

275
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:15,522
OK, now we go on to the jewels.

276
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:20,822
We're auctioning this ring,
mounted with two amethysts.

277
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:25,964
The mount is silver,
and the stones are amethysts.

278
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,019
We start at 100 francs.

279
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:32,186
110 bid by the lady in the
black tulle at the back on the left.

280
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:35,356
120, 130, 130 on the left.

281
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:38,481
Nobody bids higher? 140, 150, 160...

282
00:21:38,516 --> 00:21:44,500
180, 185, 190, a bid of 200
at the back on the right.

283
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:47,723
210, nobody more? 220.

284
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,912
230, once, twice, thrice.

285
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:54,261
Awarded for 230 francs
to the lady with the tulle.

286
00:21:57,558 --> 00:21:59,656
Thank you, thank you very much.

287
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:16,850
Listen, Mrs. Rambaud,
I'm not in, for nobody.

288
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:23,096
Yes? Ah, Mr. Davenne
is not in, he's on a trip.

289
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:01,005
I found your ring, Julie.

290
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,974
I wanted to give it to you today,
without waiting for your birthday.

291
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,151
I've not forgotten you, Julie. I don't
forget you, in spite of the years.

292
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:47,557
On the contrary,
I think about you more and more.

293
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,860
This night that's starting,
we'll pass it together.

294
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:03,389
Alright, it's a
bother but we cannot wait longer.

295
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:07,588
OK, I'll tell your friend Davenne
that you came to see him.

296
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:10,953
No, don't tell him,
I'd like it to be a surprise.

297
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,969
Understand it, he helped me
so much when my first wife died.

298
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:17,453
I thought he'd like it
if I present him Yvonne.

299
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:20,573
- Ah, it's you!
- Yes, I'm Yvonne Mazet,

300
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:22,439
we married last month in Paris.

301
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,410
My compliments to you both.

302
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:26,824
I went to spend some time
in the house of my cousin,

303
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:27,902
to have a change of air.

304
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:29,913
We met at the station,

305
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:31,890
and on arriving
at your house I got the wrong floor.

306
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,260
I rang the door
and it was Yvonne who opened it.

307
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:36,178
I was very lucky.

308
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:38,753
No, it's me, Gerard, who was lucky.

309
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:41,615
You know, this horrible war
has killed so many men,

310
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,518
that it condemned many women

311
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,703
to stay single.

312
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:47,564
I feel very happy that we met.

313
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,768
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

314
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:56,030
You can see the happiness in your face.
I was a pleasure to see you.

315
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:59,065
And, of course I'll keep the secret.

316
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,516
His wife died a few months ago
and he already replaced her.

317
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,542
Genevieve Mazet was blond like wheat,

318
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,535
the new Mrs. Mazet is brown like ebony.

319
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:18,168
I imagine that for him
it was just a change of hair color.

320
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,940
And he even had the impudence
to come and present her to me,

321
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,059
thinking that I'd like it.

322
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:23,402
Why keep that men from loving?

323
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:25,583
Why stop him to rebuild his life?

324
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:28,095
You think people cannot love two times?

325
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,233
- I don't know.
- You really don't know?

326
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:34,802
I can only tell you
that when his wife died,

327
00:27:34,837 --> 00:27:36,553
the true one, not the impostress,

328
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,136
Mazet
got in a state of absolute despair.

329
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,280
If you'd have seen
his face, distorted by crying,

330
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:44,298
he even tried suicide in front of me.

331
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,746
I staid with him,
talked to him, tried to help him.

332
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:50,048
And that wonderful woman
who dedicated her life to him,

333
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:52,315
he replaced her as if she was a servant.

334
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,847
I cannot agree with your indignation.

335
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,760
Why would the 2nd Mrs. Mazet

336
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,638
erase the memory of the dead one?

337
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:00,412
Who tells you that this marriage

338
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,152
isn't just another way of remembering?

339
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:04,365
Almost all my friends died in the war.

340
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,350
You think
other friends have replaced them?

341
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:11,063
How could
the disappeared hope to remain,

342
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:13,676
if it were not
in the memory of those who live?

343
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:17,038
A short while ago
I went back to St. Germain,

344
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:19,335
where I spent 2 years of the war.

345
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,777
The combats were so violent there,

346
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:23,925
that the soil is full of shells,

347
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:26,038
and the earth itself
has become uncultivable.

348
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,367
So that
in this cruel world without pity

349
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:30,662
I want to have the right not to forget.

350
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:32,903
Even if I have to be
the only one who doesn't forget.

351
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:38,575
I cannot find words as easily as you.

352
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:43,142
But I firmly believe
that it's necessary to forget.

353
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,687
Excuse me, I've been stupid.

354
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:56,136
It's my fault,
I've spoken brutally to you.

355
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:03,148
- It's true, you're too brutal.
- Probably because of my solitude.

356
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:05,310
It's very rare I have
the opportunity to talk with somebody

357
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,438
in private, like we are doing right now.

358
00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:11,355
So I imagine that
I've simply lost the habit of listening.

359
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:19,933
I told you before that
I had a reason for remembering you.

360
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:24,641
You didn't ask me to tell you,
can I tell you now?

361
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,234
I'm listening to you.

362
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,422
I thought we were alike...

363
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,398
because we have some
important things in common.

364
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,960
For years,
when people talked about you to me,

365
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:38,451
they said you were the man whose wife

366
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,929
appeared to him
at the moment of her death,

367
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,069
even though
being thousands of miles apart.

368
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,357
That's right,
that's what happened to me.

369
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:47,992
But at times I'm sorry
that I've talked about it.

370
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:49,796
I should have kept it a secret.

371
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,890
I understand.

372
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,602
At that time it was almost a fable.

373
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:57,591
I think the others have forgotten it,

374
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,249
but I remember it often,

375
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:02,614
because later the same thing
happened to me with my father...

376
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:05,429
almost the same.

377
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,209
Well, it's very long ago.

378
00:30:08,944 --> 00:30:11,250
No, I'd like you to tell it to me.

379
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:13,530
Wait, I'll stop the car.

380
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:18,715
I'm listening to you.

381
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:22,394
My mother had died 5 years before,

382
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,080
and my father had
sent me to a boarding school.

383
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,692
I only saw him at holidays.

384
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,821
One day,
9 years ago, the 17th of March,

385
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:34,050
on a school visit
to the Louvre museum,

386
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:37,819
I stayed alone in front of a painting

387
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,291
in a small exposition room.

388
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:41,543
There were only two persons present.

389
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:45,635
A guard, and a visitor,
whom I thought at first was a tourist.

390
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,961
I only noticed that he wore no hat

391
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:50,853
and that he sat on a sofa.

392
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:54,721
At the very moment
that I looked at him again,

393
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:57,439
I recognized my father.

394
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,365
He looked at me,

395
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:06,075
he smiled at me
and he held out his arms to me.

396
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,651
So I ran towards him, very happy

397
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,850
opening my arms too.

398
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:13,787
But he disappeared.

399
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,260
That same evening
I received a telegram

400
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:18,698
announcing his death.

401
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,550
It had happened at the very time

402
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:22,567
he appeared to me in the museum.

403
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:27,543
You know, somehow
that vision made my sorrow lighter.

404
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:34,218
And the image of him
I've kept is of that apparition.

405
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:38,504
The story they told me
about you and the death of your wife

406
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:41,008
made a big impression on me.

407
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:44,854
And later, always when thinking
about the death of my father,

408
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:47,104
my thoughts led me to you.

409
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,858
Yes, we've had the same experience.

410
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:53,861
That's why we love the dead,
we don't want them to be forgotten.

411
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:56,743
We can't accept
that they're betrayed, we are similar.

412
00:31:56,778 --> 00:31:59,272
No, we are not similar.

413
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:01,786
True, I love the dead, I respect them,

414
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:04,116
but I love the living just as well.

415
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:07,490
Listen, somebody dies,
a child comes into the world,

416
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,220
new friends can
replace those who disappeared.

417
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:12,071
It's the natural flow of life.

418
00:32:12,106 --> 00:32:15,079
A man adores his wife and
suffers the misfortune of losing her.

419
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:17,952
Well, I think
it's normal that he loves again.

420
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:20,796
It's natural.

421
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:25,337
No, if you want to talk
about Mazet you will not convince me.

422
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:28,927
I think Mazet's
conduct has been unspeakable.

423
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:30,718
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

424
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,474
I thought we had the same ideas.

425
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:34,404
I thought so too.

426
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:37,310
We don't have
the same way of loving the dead.

427
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:39,708
You love the dead against the living.

428
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:42,570
I can go home now.

429
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:19,076
I prefer to say goodbye here.
Don't accompany me.

430
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,418
As you wish.

431
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:42,034
One moment, hang on.

432
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:45,116
Mr. Bishop?

433
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:54,164
Hello?

434
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,465
When will it take place.

435
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,028
I have work for you.

436
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:11,923
Massigny has died.

437
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,338
What! Has he died?

438
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:15,943
Yes, in an accident.
In a most stupid way.

439
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:19,047
He stopped on the highway
so that his companion could get out...

440
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:23,527
and on opening the door,
a truck knocked him over.

441
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,351
So Massigny is dead.

442
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,214
Yes, they brought his body to town.

443
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,110
The burial
will be the day after tomorrow.

444
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:31,731
The hotels are full.
Many people arrived from Paris.

445
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:34,105
Politicians, reporters,
and not only men...

446
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,870
Massigny liked women.

447
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:40,339
Monique will give you
the documentation about him.

448
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:43,199
I don't need
documentation to write about him.

449
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:13,617
I just finished
the article on Massigny...

450
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:16,297
but I didn't have
the courage to read it again.

451
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,554
Mr. Davenne... the Massigny file.

452
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,173
And what do you want me to do with it?

453
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,644
Mr. Bishop wants you
to pick a photo for the article.

454
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:40,636
This is Massigny
on an official trip to Russia.

455
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:43,411
A yes, that was in '23.

456
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:46,940
Here,
at the tomb of the unknown soldier.

457
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:52,643
Massigny
at the moment of the Tunis crisis.

458
00:35:52,678 --> 00:35:55,541
I didn't know this photo.

459
00:35:55,976 --> 00:36:00,222
And this is the
famous photo of the missing minister.

460
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:05,356
And here, just a portrait.
This one's already been published.

461
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:07,776
And this other one doesn't look good.

462
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:12,547
Listen, I don't want
to choose myself. You do it.

463
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:14,959
- OK, good afternoon Monique.
- Good afternoon sir.

464
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,727
Davenne, wait!

465
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:32,762
But, what has got into you?

466
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:35,198
You're not expecting
that we publish this?

467
00:36:35,412 --> 00:36:37,778
What's wrong with it?
Is it too short, or what?

468
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:40,295
Did you realize
in what way you talk about him?

469
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:42,825
It looks like
you'd want him to die a second time.

470
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,115
Give me the article.
Ask somebody else to write it.

471
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,838
But...
I thought you two were very close.

472
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,999
I don't understand.

473
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,025
That's why I suggest that the article

474
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,057
be written by someone
who didn't know Massigny.

475
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:57,030
He was my best friend, and since
the day he stopped being that,

476
00:36:57,065 --> 00:36:58,462
nobody has replaced him.

477
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:01,056
He taught me a very difficult lesson.

478
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:03,662
When you accept
that you belong to society,

479
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:06,618
you have to protect
yourself from profound disgust.

480
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,435
The truth is that you hated him.

481
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,086
No, hate is no part
of my way of looking at life.

482
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,934
But true, when
I think of him, I think of the man

483
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,545
who has done me
more damage than anybody else.

484
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,292
Through him, I saw that for some

485
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:22,265
life is a ferocious competition
in which everything is permitted.

486
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,635
That's why I got out
of the race, and thanks to Massigny

487
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,819
I became a spectator of life.

488
00:37:29,274 --> 00:37:32,172
You are right, he was my friend,
and the only thing I feel today,

489
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:36,185
on learning of his death,
is an immense relief.

490
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:51,071
Which advantages
would Massigny have obtained

491
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:53,500
of a triumphal entrance

492
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,652
in the City Council
of the City of Paris?

493
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:58,477
We ask ourselves.

494
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:01,472
Instead of
an almost humiliating failure

495
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:04,808
he shed light on the urgent necessity

496
00:38:04,843 --> 00:38:07,948
not to improve universal suffrage

497
00:38:07,983 --> 00:38:10,398
but to abolish it.

498
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:15,729
During 2 months, the incomparable
polemist that was Paul Massigny,

499
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:19,399
confined to newspaper columns,

500
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:22,243
methodically took his distance.

501
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:25,810
And then, speaking of
the proposal for a new law

502
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,458
on renewing banking privileges

503
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:32,885
that risked putting almost all of

504
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,165
the national wealth
in the hands of the Rothchilds,

505
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,362
Paul Massigny
threw himself at Minister Bridoux

506
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:42,444
with such ferocity

507
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:45,880
that the authorities
cannot stay indifferent.

508
00:38:45,915 --> 00:38:48,626
Accused in court

509
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:51,337
he is condemned to
3 months imprisonment

510
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:54,403
but he breathes freely
because a breach has been opened.

511
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:59,116
So, the all pervading
injustice has marked him.

512
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:03,860
And this time
in a vital part, in the soul.

513
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:07,699
Nevertheless, Massigny
carries out his managerial duties,

514
00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:10,239
once this fire has been extinguished.

515
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:14,483
The number of subscribers
triples in a few weeks.

516
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,600
His team of co-workers
closes ranks with him.

517
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:24,075
During the years,
Massigny is up against grand rivals.

518
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,433
Some of whom are honoring
us today with their presence,

519
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:29,482
others have died.

520
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:33,430
But nobody had
such significance, with such force

521
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:35,789
for the renewal of social thinking.

522
00:39:35,824 --> 00:39:38,424
Because nobody
has been insulted so patiently,

523
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:41,024
for so long a time.

524
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,657
They will ask themselves:

525
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:48,855
why rekindle the fire of hate again.

526
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,606
But whoever believes to see hate here

527
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:56,323
only shows his heart is mixed up.

528
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,124
De profound cry
emitted by the work of Massigny,

529
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,878
which will resonate forever,
is that of a free man.

530
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,824
Quick, close the windows!

531
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:15,742
Go and get water!

532
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,587
I have not been able
to protect you, Julie.

533
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,181
I have to think of something
to have you closer to me.

534
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,764
Good day, sir.

535
00:42:47,156 --> 00:42:49,325
I don't know if you remember me.
I came 2 weeks ago.

536
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,825
I'm coming to see if my order is ready.

537
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,541
Yes, yes, it's ready.

538
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:05,403
I hope you'll feel satisfied.

539
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:18,952
No, that's not it at all.
I'm very disappointed.

540
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:20,990
But it's exactly
as on the photo you gave me.

541
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:22,454
No, that's not possible, that's not her.

542
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:24,432
I don't want to take this thing.

543
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,825
But sir, impossible,
with al the work I put into it!

544
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,282
- Here, I prefer to pay you.
- No way.

545
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:31,710
- Take the money, sir.
- I cannot accept it.

546
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:33,595
- Take this money.
- No way.

547
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,165
Take this money and
destroy this right now, in front of me.

548
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,477
I cannot do it.

549
00:43:37,478 --> 00:43:38,955
Destroy this thing immediately.

550
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,016
There is no hope for me any more, Julie.

551
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:05,821
I had the impression
of losing you again.

552
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:09,105
I beg you, Julie, don't abandon me.

553
00:48:31,664 --> 00:48:33,115
Sir, before granting you an audience,

554
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,912
I have to know more
about you and your project.

555
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:36,960
Your letter is not very explicit.

556
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:40,005
Moreover, why exactly this chapel?

557
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,144
It has been very damaged by the war...

558
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:44,675
and we are not planning
to open it for service again.

559
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,517
Our diocese has a too few priests,

560
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:54,007
and those are called
to more urgent duties.

561
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,527
Tell me, what do you want to do with it?

562
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:58,405
I want to take
responsibility for that chapel.

563
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,707
To take its restoration
and maintenance upon myself.

564
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:02,137
I've chosen it precisely

565
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,892
because it's been
abandoned by the faithful.

566
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:06,377
By dedicating it to my dead
I will not remove its original goal.

567
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:09,458
What do you mean with 'your dead'?

568
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:13,172
I think of all the persons
who counted in my life,

569
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:14,467
and who are not here any more.

570
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:16,934
For a long time I thought
that the memory was sufficient.

571
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:18,922
Now I know that I
have to do something more for them.

572
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,748
This chapel can help me.

573
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:22,822
Are you planning
to found some kind of sect?

574
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:24,722
Not at all. I only believe

575
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:26,656
that the moment has come
to offer the dead

576
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:28,665
testimony of the love
to which they are entitled.

577
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,017
Do you have links with freemasonry?

578
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:33,006
Certainly not.

579
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:39,880
Do you have a spiritual leader
who can be responsible for you?

580
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:41,005
Well...

581
00:49:47,438 --> 00:49:50,595
I don't.
You'll have to have confidence in me.

582
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,760
- There's no choice.
- Are you a catholic?

583
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:58,548
For a long time
I've asked myself whether I had faith.

584
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:01,670
But now I'm sure and proud

585
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:04,758
of not having the faith
that many would wish for.

586
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,253
What does that mean?

587
00:50:06,288 --> 00:50:07,827
What shocks me is the miserable way

588
00:50:07,862 --> 00:50:09,431
in which we forget the dead.

589
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:10,938
I want to repair that injustice.

590
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:12,976
They don't have
celebrations, no honor,

591
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:14,727
no shelter, no security.

592
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,160
How this wish
to rescue from oblivion came about,

593
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:19,559
I couldn't tell you,
but I've invented them a ritual.

594
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:22,792
And because you dispose of some money,

595
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,990
you'd like to realize that cult.

596
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:31,155
That's it. I've thought of candles.
Each dead would have his own.

597
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,806
And together they'd form
a forest of lighted flames,

598
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,203
day and night for their memory.

599
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:36,352
A forest of flames?

600
00:50:41,736 --> 00:50:43,888
I don't know what to tell you.

601
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,043
The church
doesn't appreciate excesses at all.

602
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:57,746
Hello,
you didn't want to see me anymore?

603
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,259
I thought it was you
who didn't want to see me.

604
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:05,374
Sure, but the last time your goodbye

605
00:52:05,409 --> 00:52:07,542
was like an order to silence.

606
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:09,827
You haven't felt tempted
to break that order?

607
00:52:09,862 --> 00:52:13,572
No, I've been raised to be obedient.

608
00:52:14,107 --> 00:52:17,400
Me too, I know obedience.

609
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:20,501
I didn't want
to avoid you, on the contrary.

610
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:23,032
Since our last meeting
something has happened

611
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:24,785
that made me come closer to your ideas.

612
00:52:28,914 --> 00:52:30,530
Our dead,

613
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:33,817
our poor dead,

614
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:36,786
they ask so little,
and they obtain even less.

615
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,941
I often find myself right here.

616
00:52:39,976 --> 00:52:42,451
I think I don't like cemeteries,

617
00:52:42,486 --> 00:52:44,854
they're cold prisons
where they lock up the dead,

618
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:47,148
to get rid of them
under the frozen soil.

619
00:52:47,183 --> 00:52:49,524
No, I don't think so.

620
00:52:49,525 --> 00:52:51,865
They're at home, below the ground.

621
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,975
Do you know that
the Chinese opposed the construction

622
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,779
of the railroad for a long time?

623
00:52:55,814 --> 00:52:57,271
They couldn't bear

624
00:52:57,272 --> 00:52:59,129
that the soil
of the dead would be touched.

625
00:52:59,164 --> 00:53:01,094
I think that,
if so many people honored them,

626
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,624
it's because the feared them.

627
00:53:02,959 --> 00:53:05,277
But we, we love them.

628
00:53:05,278 --> 00:53:06,437
True?

629
00:53:06,472 --> 00:53:09,213
Yes, you're right, we love them.

630
00:53:12,752 --> 00:53:14,510
Listen, I have a big project.

631
00:53:14,545 --> 00:53:16,013
It's still early to talk about it,

632
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:18,364
but you'll be the first
to know about it.

633
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:21,343
But please be careful.

634
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:23,987
You worry me with you initiatives.

635
00:54:17,374 --> 00:54:20,597
It's a letter from the bishop.

636
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,704
I'm very happy.

637
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:28,340
We're going to repair the chapel.

638
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:35,099
There will be works, scaffoldings.

639
00:54:35,134 --> 00:54:40,591
I'll take you with me.

640
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:44,637
There will be many painters.

641
00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:49,945
We're going to work together.

642
00:55:52,465 --> 00:55:53,856
Ah yes, very well.

643
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:12,427
Thank you, Georges.

644
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:19,408
She's pretty, isn't she?

645
00:56:19,846 --> 00:56:21,992
Yes, Julie was very pretty.

646
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:25,496
I understood
that Julie'd be with us always...

647
00:56:25,531 --> 00:56:28,162
as long as I'd live
amidst everything that belonged to her.

648
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:30,403
But I'm going to make more for her.

649
00:56:30,438 --> 00:56:33,446
A final refuge
where she'll shine in all her splendor.

650
00:56:33,481 --> 00:56:36,137
An altar of light
where she will be the central flame.

651
00:56:37,182 --> 00:56:43,975
Julie, eternally young,
loyal, courageous,

652
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,459
magnificent Julie.

653
00:56:45,494 --> 00:56:47,160
Alright Georges, go.

654
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,449
If you think
I'm an old fool, you're right.

655
00:56:49,484 --> 00:56:51,193
Bring it to the car.

656
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,889
Thank you, Georges.

657
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:14,210
Thank you, madam.

658
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:21,442
Bye bye, see you this evening.

659
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:46,965
You see,
I told you you'd be the first to know.

660
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,699
The moment has come. Come with me

661
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,464
and excuse me
if I don't tell you anything more.

662
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:53,296
- Do you trust me?
- Of course I trust you.

663
00:57:53,331 --> 00:57:55,979
Anyway, I find it very mysterious.

664
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,682
I think you're going
to ask me to put a veil over my eyes.

665
00:57:58,717 --> 00:57:59,966
No, I won't.

666
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:29,281
Listen, I'm not ready yet.
I want you to wait for me here.

667
00:58:29,316 --> 00:58:31,565
If you don't mind,
I'll come looking for you.

668
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:33,634
A little while more, please.

669
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:45,160
Now we can enter.

670
01:01:05,757 --> 01:01:07,243
My dead now have

671
01:01:07,304 --> 01:01:09,219
a place that is irrevocably theirs.

672
01:01:09,254 --> 01:01:12,208
And this old chapel will
no longer be a place of death,

673
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:14,688
not a place of rest,
but a place of life.

674
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:17,318
As long as we're alive,
you and I, these flames

675
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:21,447
will continue to shine and breathe
to the rhythm of the human heart.

676
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,708
None of them should be put out.

677
01:01:24,343 --> 01:01:26,585
But all these photos...

678
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,302
Did you know all these persons?

679
01:01:28,337 --> 01:01:30,011
Yes, they are
my friends who disappeared.

680
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:31,293
You are young,

681
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:32,941
but you'll see
that at a certain moment

682
01:01:32,976 --> 01:01:35,269
you know more dead people than living.

683
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:43,791
This man for example, who was he?

684
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:47,233
His name was
Simon Jardine, he was from Ireland.

685
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:49,761
During the 30 years
he lived in our region,

686
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:51,867
the police and the justice dept.
didn't have much to do.

687
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:54,757
His reputation of integrity was such

688
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:56,357
that all who had disagreements

689
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:58,660
preferred his arbitrage
to settle their conflicts.

690
01:01:59,398 --> 01:02:01,962
And this couple?

691
01:02:01,997 --> 01:02:04,632
They married in 1911.

692
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,754
For 3 years they were
always together, every day.

693
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,058
And when the mobilized him,

694
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,328
she wanted to jump out of the window.

695
01:02:11,363 --> 01:02:13,235
But the neighbors stopped her.

696
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,968
Later he deserted, because
he couldn't bear being without her.

697
01:02:16,003 --> 01:02:18,138
They managed to reach Holland...

698
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:20,273
where they died a few years ago.

699
01:02:20,308 --> 01:02:23,448
With an interval
of a few days, like Siamese twins.

700
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,581
Look at this man,
with his beautiful face.

701
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:32,266
All his life he suffered from timidity.

702
01:02:32,301 --> 01:02:34,825
I'd like to
tell you about him, but it's difficult.

703
01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:36,863
You'd have to hear
the tone of his voice,

704
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:38,599
which was extraordinary.

705
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:42,742
This one is American.
He liked Europe so much,

706
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:44,602
that he ended up
opting for English nationality.

707
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:48,465
I knew him only a little,
but because of him,

708
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,065
I learned of
the importance of respect for our dead.

709
01:02:56,467 --> 01:02:57,586
And this little boy?

710
01:02:57,621 --> 01:03:01,007
When I was still an adolescent,

711
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:03,294
I saw him die, on a summer holiday.

712
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:04,852
He died of septicemia.

713
01:03:05,387 --> 01:03:08,033
This woman also died very young.

714
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:10,594
But in the way
that all would like to die:

715
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:12,346
sleeping in her bed.

716
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:14,642
She went out
like the flame of one of these candles.

717
01:03:14,677 --> 01:03:17,080
I see that her family has written:

718
01:03:17,115 --> 01:03:19,134
remember her in your prayers.

719
01:03:19,135 --> 01:03:21,653
Although this woman was
the irreverence incarnate.

720
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:24,433
I remember her way
of halting an animated discussion.

721
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,421
She exclaimed if God would exist,

722
01:03:26,422 --> 01:03:28,375
I'd be the first to know about it.

723
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:33,879
And this soldier?

724
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:36,905
Yes, it's a German soldier.

725
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,463
I'm one of his murderers,
because I was a gunner

726
01:03:39,498 --> 01:03:41,189
in the battery that got his plane down.

727
01:03:41,224 --> 01:03:42,752
He seems to sleep.

728
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:43,700
That's correct.

729
01:03:43,828 --> 01:03:45,909
It's the only photo we found of him.

730
01:03:45,944 --> 01:03:47,247
I have to say that,
looking at this photo,

731
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,306
it's difficult to consider him an enemy.

732
01:03:50,441 --> 01:03:52,423
Ant that musician?

733
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:56,873
Did you know him?

734
01:03:56,908 --> 01:03:59,796
Yes, I had almost forgotten him.

735
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:02,157
But one day, hearing a piece on the radio

736
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:03,629
that he had composed,

737
01:04:03,664 --> 01:04:05,819
I realized that his music,
full of quality and light,

738
01:04:05,854 --> 01:04:07,722
was the right one to accompany

739
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,490
the memory of all my dead.

740
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:38,718
So they are all here.

741
01:04:40,724 --> 01:04:42,818
All those you knew.

742
01:04:42,853 --> 01:04:44,876
All those who meant something to you.

743
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:47,131
Yes, they're all here.

744
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:55,052
And now I'd like to ask you something.

745
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,859
- Can I?
- Yes.

746
01:05:09,888 --> 01:05:11,895
Cecilia, do you
accept to become, with me,

747
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:13,903
the guardian of this temple?

748
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:15,904
To share its rights and duties?

749
01:05:15,939 --> 01:05:20,249
Do you accept to care
for them with me, for all of them?

750
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:23,515
Don't answer me right away,
think it over if you want.

751
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,785
But let me tell you that I've waited

752
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,205
for this moment for a long time.

753
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,103
For a very long time.

754
01:05:28,654 --> 01:05:31,831
I wish that my dead be yours.

755
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,962
And in turn, that yours be mine too.

756
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:36,821
Don't think that this set is finished.

757
01:05:36,856 --> 01:05:39,273
There's place for all of your dead.

758
01:05:39,308 --> 01:05:41,972
Their flames will simply
add themselves to these.

759
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:44,124
Tell me what you wish.

760
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:46,773
- What I wish?
- Yes.

761
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:48,171
Do you want to know?

762
01:05:50,057 --> 01:05:52,761
I wish that all these flames mingle

763
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:58,169
to form a mountain of light,

764
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,060
one big luminosity.

765
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,253
Do you mean that in your life

766
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:04,668
there's only place for one celebration?

767
01:06:04,703 --> 01:06:06,811
Yes, one celebration.

768
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:10,000
I want to make sure
that I understood you.

769
01:06:10,035 --> 01:06:12,278
In a way that
all your dead are only one?

770
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,073
One only, yes.

771
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:44,250
But, Georges!

772
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:48,541
What did you do
with the plates? What did you do?

773
01:06:51,231 --> 01:06:52,893
Go to bed without supper.

774
01:06:56,843 --> 01:06:58,587
- What did you do to him?
- I've sent him to bed.

775
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:00,062
Look, he broke my plates.

776
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,450
You, come here!

777
01:08:42,396 --> 01:08:43,705
Cecilia, do you want to help me?

778
01:08:43,706 --> 01:08:45,671
The important thing is to find that boy.

779
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:47,534
Does Georges have
family or friends around here?

780
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:49,301
No, just Mrs. Rambaud,

781
01:08:49,302 --> 01:08:51,034
my housekeeper, who takes care of him.

782
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:53,153
Listen, on the one hand
there are the hospitals,

783
01:08:53,188 --> 01:08:56,272
on the other the police.
Let's divide the task.

784
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:58,673
- You go to the hospital.
- Yes, that's it.

785
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,364
They didn't put him here,
he'll be in the other.

786
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:20,147
Wait here, miss.

787
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:33,657
Where can that little brat be?

788
01:09:33,658 --> 01:09:35,881
Ah, here he is. Let's go, out.

789
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:37,656
What are you doing under there?

790
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:47,491
Don't be afraid. I will bring you home.

791
01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:49,923
Drink, my little one.

792
01:09:56,032 --> 01:09:57,690
Sorry to hear about your money trouble.

793
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:00,830
But I can't help thinking

794
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:02,291
that those conferences are a good thing.

795
01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:05,365
They are occasions
for people to know your works.

796
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,338
True, until now I lacked ambition,

797
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:10,221
probably because I was alone.

798
01:10:10,256 --> 01:10:12,697
But now there's
that chapel to maintain, so that...

799
01:10:13,932 --> 01:10:15,910
When will you leave?

800
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,714
The day after tomorrow. But don't worry.

801
01:10:18,749 --> 01:10:21,791
Since I have the chapel,
my dead defend me.

802
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,238
I have the impression
that they protect me.

803
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,476
I'm sure you understand me.

804
01:10:25,115 --> 01:10:28,595
Yes, I feel almost the same as you.

805
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:32,746
But for you, that chapel
reconciles you with your future.

806
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:34,447
and for me, with my past.

807
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:37,460
Little by little I'm accepting the idea

808
01:10:37,461 --> 01:10:39,155
that I'm caring for it with you.

809
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:42,097
It feels like getting out of an illness.

810
01:10:42,132 --> 01:10:44,131
To go towards the cure.

811
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:47,109
Don't know if I told you before, but

812
01:10:47,144 --> 01:10:50,375
without knowing, you've helped me a lot.

813
01:10:51,027 --> 01:10:54,045
And you're going to help me even more.

814
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:57,031
While I'm away,
you'll be the temple's guardian.

815
01:10:57,066 --> 01:11:00,099
Yes, the guardian. Here's the key.

816
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,539
Besides, another thing.

817
01:11:06,702 --> 01:11:08,618
Cecilia, I've chosen you as the one

818
01:11:08,619 --> 01:11:10,263
who will complete the whole.

819
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:11,864
Complete the whole?

820
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:14,714
Yes, that will happen
when the last candle will be lighted,

821
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:16,513
and I want you
to be the one who will light it.

822
01:11:16,548 --> 01:11:17,468
But which one?

823
01:11:18,913 --> 01:11:21,415
Mine, Cecilia, when the moment comes.

824
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:23,852
Have a good trip.

825
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:31,013
Tell me, have you thought about,
that if one day

826
01:11:31,014 --> 01:11:33,987
I have to light a candle for you,

827
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:37,500
then, who will light a candle for me?

828
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,173
- Hello.
- Hello, come in.

829
01:13:22,085 --> 01:13:25,169
- Did you come back yesterday?
- Yes. No, this morning.

830
01:13:25,204 --> 01:13:26,957
I traveled all night,
I arrived this morning.

831
01:13:28,381 --> 01:13:31,026
Anne, go on with
that part, I'll be right back.

832
01:13:31,061 --> 01:13:33,067
Could you wait for a moment?

833
01:13:33,068 --> 01:13:35,073
The lesson is almost over.

834
01:13:35,108 --> 01:13:38,452
It's the first time I visit you house.

835
01:13:38,487 --> 01:13:40,921
I wonder whether
I shouldn't take some piano lessons.

836
01:13:40,956 --> 01:13:42,274
Piano lessons?

837
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:45,089
Yes, if I would be your pupil
I'd have some rights on you.

838
01:13:45,124 --> 01:13:46,854
You want to have rights on me?

839
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:50,836
I'll ask you something.

840
01:13:50,871 --> 01:13:53,562
What's the color of my eyes?

841
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:57,313
Wait... no... I admit that...

842
01:13:57,348 --> 01:13:59,113
You see?

843
01:15:04,313 --> 01:15:05,457
What's up? Are you going?

844
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:06,837
I shouldn't have come here.

845
01:15:06,872 --> 01:15:09,012
On breaching that door
I've ruined everything.

846
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:38,575
Listen miss, give me 2215 please.

847
01:16:39,676 --> 01:16:42,773
Hello Albert, it's me, Julien Davenne.

848
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:45,290
How can you call me
at this hour? Whatís happening to you?

849
01:16:45,325 --> 01:16:47,403
Excuse me, it's about Massigny,

850
01:16:47,438 --> 01:16:48,310
I need to know something about him.

851
01:16:48,345 --> 01:16:50,122
I know he was married several times, but

852
01:16:50,157 --> 01:16:52,123
where did he live these last 10 years?

853
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:53,888
What were his relationships?

854
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:55,481
I want to know the name of the person

855
01:16:55,516 --> 01:16:57,242
who could best inform me
about him, and what's more

856
01:16:57,277 --> 01:17:00,142
I need to know who was his last lover.

857
01:17:00,177 --> 01:17:02,526
Listen, I don't know what
happened between Massigny and you,

858
01:17:02,527 --> 01:17:04,001
and I don't want to know it.

859
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,280
Speaking frankly,

860
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:08,524
you're starting to bother everybody.

861
01:17:08,559 --> 01:17:10,870
Within a month we stop working together.

862
01:17:10,905 --> 01:17:13,929
Allow me a piece of advice,
forget your hate of Massigny,

863
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:15,835
it's really below your dignity.

864
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:31,813
Even though you
might think I have no dignity, I came.

865
01:17:39,457 --> 01:17:43,092
I'm here to know. I need to know.

866
01:17:43,127 --> 01:17:45,250
One day you told me that all your dead

867
01:17:45,251 --> 01:17:46,612
were one.

868
01:17:46,647 --> 01:17:48,281
Now I know everything.

869
01:17:48,316 --> 01:17:50,890
I know that
this unique dead was Paul Massigny.

870
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:56,836
Yes, it's Paul Massigny.

871
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:00,039
Did you know him?

872
01:18:00,074 --> 01:18:03,202
Yes, he was my friend in adolescence

873
01:18:03,217 --> 01:18:04,350
and during my whole youth.

874
01:18:04,385 --> 01:18:06,648
But he betrayed me.

875
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:08,443
He destroyed the faith I had in life.

876
01:18:08,478 --> 01:18:09,869
He taught me suspicion.

877
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:13,341
Me too, at times I thought I hated him.

878
01:18:14,908 --> 01:18:17,725
But when he died I realized
that I could never forget him.

879
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,766
He was very good
in seducing, dominating, subjugating.

880
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:23,368
Even today,
Massigny manages to trouble my life...

881
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,401
he separates us.

882
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:27,341
Now I know there was a bond between you,

883
01:18:27,376 --> 01:18:29,757
I want to know more
and I'm ashamed of this curiosity.

884
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,096
And why
did you never talk to me about him?

885
01:18:36,523 --> 01:18:38,624
While he lived,
I had no right to talk about him.

886
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:41,402
Anyway, I had no right at all.

887
01:18:41,437 --> 01:18:43,759
Our history did not belong to me.

888
01:18:43,794 --> 01:18:46,333
When he died, remember,

889
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:48,873
it was the time I stopped seeing you.

890
01:18:48,908 --> 01:18:51,540
It made no sense
any more to talk about him.

891
01:18:51,575 --> 01:18:53,786
Our history was finished.

892
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:58,941
About the cemetery,
where we met by chance,

893
01:18:58,976 --> 01:19:02,230
Did you never ask yourself
which tomb I was visiting?

894
01:19:02,265 --> 01:19:04,316
Yes, but at the moment
I had the feeling

895
01:19:04,317 --> 01:19:06,368
of opening a letter
that was not addressed to me.

896
01:19:06,403 --> 01:19:09,904
Well, now we have
one more thing in common.

897
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:12,925
You and I have suffered by him.

898
01:19:15,139 --> 01:19:18,225
It's true
that Paul led me almost to despair.

899
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,251
But I've forgiven him.

900
01:19:25,455 --> 01:19:26,917
I've also forgiven him.

901
01:19:26,918 --> 01:19:30,326
Ah, that's good.

902
01:19:30,361 --> 01:19:32,349
I shouldn't have doubted you.

903
01:19:33,432 --> 01:19:35,399
This place itself is the proof

904
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:38,179
that hate has no place in you.

905
01:19:38,214 --> 01:19:40,579
No, there's no place here for hate.

906
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:42,653
Look at these flames,
look how the shine,

907
01:19:42,688 --> 01:19:44,395
how they are alive.

908
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:46,399
I could call each one by its name,

909
01:19:46,434 --> 01:19:47,672
I recognize each candle.

910
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:50,020
Where is Paul's candle?

911
01:19:50,055 --> 01:19:51,031
Pardon me?

912
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:53,719
Where is the candle of Paul Massigny?

913
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:55,704
Why do we need
a candle for Paul Massigny?

914
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:58,047
As if he's
present for you in this splendor.

915
01:19:58,082 --> 01:20:00,108
You just told me
that you had forgiven him.

916
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:01,373
Is he not one of your dead?

917
01:20:01,812 --> 01:20:03,780
No, he is one of the dead of this world.

918
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,742
And now I know that he is yours,
but he is not one of mine.

919
01:20:05,777 --> 01:20:08,313
Those who were
mine in life, are mine in death.

920
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:12,587
But he was your friend in life,
even if one day he cease to be so.

921
01:20:12,622 --> 01:20:14,226
Those we have loved should...

922
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:16,200
Those are the ones
who can do us the most damage.

923
01:20:16,235 --> 01:20:19,025
It's not true!
You have not forgiven him!

924
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,384
Goodbye.

925
01:20:23,329 --> 01:20:25,427
Where are you going?
Won't I see you ever again?

926
01:20:25,462 --> 01:20:27,925
Never like before. And never here.

927
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:29,420
Come back!

928
01:20:29,455 --> 01:20:31,591
Where is Massigny's place?

929
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,389
I can't!
I cannot, why don't you understand?

930
01:20:33,424 --> 01:20:35,259
I cannot consider him equal to the rest.

931
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:37,082
Even in relation to them, I can't.

932
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:40,555
So, goodbye.

933
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,522
The enchantment is broken.

934
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:00,203
- Good morning doctor?
- Hello Mrs. Rambaud.

935
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:01,896
- How did he pass the night?
- Not very well.

936
01:21:01,931 --> 01:21:03,487
He didn't sleep much.

937
01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:05,652
I heard him walking in all directions.

938
01:21:08,519 --> 01:21:09,688
No, Doctor, he's not there.

939
01:21:09,723 --> 01:21:12,276
He is upstairs, in his room.

940
01:21:12,311 --> 01:21:14,008
He has locked
himself in the burned room.

941
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:16,666
Alright, I'll go and see him.

942
01:21:20,195 --> 01:21:21,490
Who's there, what's happening?

943
01:21:21,525 --> 01:21:23,959
It's me Davenne,
I come to see you, as we agreed.

944
01:21:23,994 --> 01:21:25,693
Youíd better go home.

945
01:21:25,728 --> 01:21:27,745
I've asked nothing of no one.
I don't need a doctor.

946
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,375
No one is ill in this house.

947
01:21:37,665 --> 01:21:39,872
One cannot treat someone
who has lost the desire to live.

948
01:21:39,873 --> 01:21:41,877
Mrs. Rambaud, I have nothing to do here.

949
01:22:17,263 --> 01:22:19,647
A young woman wants to talk with you.

950
01:22:19,682 --> 01:22:21,945
She has no appointment,
but it's about Mr. Davenne.

951
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:26,329
Ah, Davenne! How is he?

952
01:22:26,364 --> 01:22:27,644
Not very well.

953
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,826
I met Mrs. Rambaud, his housekeeper,

954
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:32,461
he is in despair.

955
01:22:33,447 --> 01:22:35,265
Let that young lady in.

956
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:43,236
Mr. Bishop expects you. Come in here.

957
01:22:54,354 --> 01:22:58,152
No, he went on a trip
to Scandinavia 2 months ago.

958
01:22:58,187 --> 01:23:00,401
But now he should be here.

959
01:23:00,436 --> 01:23:04,605
Monique,
for how long haven't we seen Davenne?

960
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,452
Almost a week, sir.

961
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:08,644
We've had to
delay his article for one issue.

962
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:11,805
Yes, he was
a bit strange after his return.

963
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,740
Do you know him well?

964
01:23:14,015 --> 01:23:17,622
You are very charming,
he should have talked to me about you.

965
01:23:17,657 --> 01:23:19,490
But really,

966
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,415
he never talks about his personal life.

967
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:24,083
Yes, he's very secretive.

968
01:23:24,118 --> 01:23:26,797
And anyway,
you surely know him better than I do.

969
01:23:26,832 --> 01:23:29,582
I met him in my adolescence,

970
01:23:29,617 --> 01:23:31,516
and then we lost sight of each other.

971
01:23:31,551 --> 01:23:34,844
And we met again
last year, accidentally.

972
01:23:34,879 --> 01:23:36,227
To tell the truth,

973
01:23:36,858 --> 01:23:38,835
he had changed a lot recently.

974
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:41,273
I should've been more inquisitive.

975
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,812
We have avoided
each other, and now I regret

976
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:45,808
not to have
urged him to explain himself.

977
01:23:45,843 --> 01:23:48,684
At times it's difficult
to be open between colleagues.

978
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,563
But... you are troubled.

979
01:23:52,598 --> 01:23:54,792
You can tell me everything.

980
01:23:54,827 --> 01:23:56,941
You like him a lot?

981
01:23:57,876 --> 01:24:00,897
I've seen him several times this year.

982
01:24:00,932 --> 01:24:04,088
And I didn't think
he'd mean so much in my life.

983
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,567
I don't know.

984
01:24:05,602 --> 01:24:08,753
And in his life,

985
01:24:08,788 --> 01:24:11,453
what place do you have in it?

986
01:24:11,988 --> 01:24:13,977
How to know that!

987
01:24:14,019 --> 01:24:16,548
He seems to like
seeing me, talking with me.

988
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:20,134
But I've noticed
that if I fail an appointment,

989
01:24:20,169 --> 01:24:24,089
he wouldn't try
to find me or give me a sign of life.

990
01:24:24,124 --> 01:24:26,719
We'd surely pass 10 years
without seeing each other.

991
01:24:26,754 --> 01:24:29,171
With him, you never know what to expect.

992
01:24:29,206 --> 01:24:31,600
You don't have to be a wizard to guess.

993
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:34,564
I believe that you love that man.

994
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,249
Excuse me if I insist.

995
01:24:39,284 --> 01:24:43,317
Does Davenne know your feelings for him?

996
01:24:43,352 --> 01:24:45,247
Does he know you love him?

997
01:24:45,282 --> 01:24:48,568
You think that would make a difference?

998
01:24:48,603 --> 01:24:50,840
Davenne is a man like any man.

999
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,988
He needs to love and be loved.

1000
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:56,439
If he makes believe
that he's used to solitude,

1001
01:24:56,474 --> 01:24:58,255
he's lying to himself.

1002
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,858
Nobody really likes solitude.

1003
01:25:01,893 --> 01:25:04,898
Make your feelings known to him.

1004
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,752
Act, don't let a misunderstanding

1005
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:10,572
stand between you two.

1006
01:25:30,311 --> 01:25:32,639
What happens? You bring me food again?

1007
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:35,576
I told you I'm not hungry.

1008
01:25:35,611 --> 01:25:39,363
It's Ms. Cecilia on the telephone.

1009
01:25:39,398 --> 01:25:41,707
I don't want to talk to her.

1010
01:25:41,742 --> 01:25:44,286
I don't want to talk to anyone,
I don't need anything.

1011
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:46,091
Myself is enough to me.

1012
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,642
Even though you refuse to talk
to me, you'll accept to read my letter.

1013
01:25:53,677 --> 01:25:55,102
I have to write you things

1014
01:25:55,103 --> 01:25:56,928
that I never dared to tell you,

1015
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:58,730
because you are unpredictable,

1016
01:25:58,731 --> 01:26:00,497
and at times your reactions frighten me.

1017
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:03,479
And because I myself
have been slow to face these things.

1018
01:26:03,514 --> 01:26:07,100
Like you, I know
it's not easy to live with the living.

1019
01:26:07,135 --> 01:26:09,484
It's easier with the dead.

1020
01:26:09,519 --> 01:26:11,468
They are locked
within the transparent walls

1021
01:26:11,503 --> 01:26:13,233
of our imagination.

1022
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:15,330
What you didn't understand,
and what I've decided to tell you,

1023
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:16,951
is that I love you.

1024
01:26:17,027 --> 01:26:18,940
But I know that to be loved by you

1025
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,195
I have to be dead.

1026
01:27:06,559 --> 01:27:08,392
Cecilia...

1027
01:27:08,927 --> 01:27:10,980
I received your letter.

1028
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:13,175
Forget that letter.

1029
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:15,266
- Cecilia...
- Don't say anything.

1030
01:27:15,301 --> 01:27:16,857
Let me talk.

1031
01:27:18,717 --> 01:27:21,867
This afternoon, by sheer luck,

1032
01:27:21,902 --> 01:27:24,842
the feeling
that separated us has left me.

1033
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:26,737
Something has changed in me.

1034
01:27:26,772 --> 01:27:28,433
To come back here, right away,

1035
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:30,094
that was the important thing.

1036
01:27:30,129 --> 01:27:32,679
From now on
we'll come for the same reason.

1037
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:35,197
- We are alike.
- Yes.

1038
01:27:41,873 --> 01:27:45,149
I'm not here to ask for anything.

1039
01:27:45,184 --> 01:27:47,079
I am here for them.

1040
01:27:47,114 --> 01:27:49,246
They are here for you.

1041
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:52,446
This night,
they are more present than ever.

1042
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:54,641
They say
there is a place for Paul Massigny.

1043
01:27:54,676 --> 01:27:56,031
Forget about Massigny!

1044
01:27:56,066 --> 01:27:57,611
They say there is an vacant spot.

1045
01:27:57,646 --> 01:28:00,039
They say that
the one whole isn't complete yet.

1046
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:03,295
Don't talk about
that vacant spot, forget about it.

1047
01:28:09,769 --> 01:28:11,663
Julien!

1048
01:28:15,244 --> 01:28:19,028
One is missing, just one.

1049
01:28:19,063 --> 01:28:21,683
Nothing is missing!

1050
01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:24,752
Only one, one more candle.

1051
01:28:24,787 --> 01:28:27,076
Then the whole will be complete.

1052
01:28:27,111 --> 01:28:29,410
Julien!

1053
01:28:29,445 --> 01:28:34,167
Cecilia, what has happened between us,

1054
01:28:34,202 --> 01:28:40,507
I know what has happened.
Nothing has happened, nothing.

1055
01:28:42,456 --> 01:28:43,660
Julien!

1056
01:29:58,496 --> 01:30:00,484
Julien Davenne.

1
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:50,452
THE BRIDE WORE BLACK

2
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:37,563
Julie, no! Julie!

3
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:25,279
- Here, Julie. Better take this, dear.
- No, Mama. I don't need it.

4
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,649
Please. For me.

5
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,718
- You must go?
- Yes, Mama. I must.

6
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,991
You will come back
if you change your mind?

7
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,531
Yes, I will.

8
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,089
Don't be sad.

9
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,508
Just tell me where you're going.
Leave me your address.

10
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:51,237
I don't have one yet.

11
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:52,938
I'll write you.

12
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,244
- Are you leaving, Aunt Julie?
- Yes. I'm going to the station.

13
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,116
- May I go with you?
- Yes, you may come with me.

14
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,266
- Looking for someone, lady?
- I'm looking for Mr. Bliss.

15
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:32,337
- I believe he lives here.
- Yes, ma'am.

16
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:35,602
- But he's not in.
- It's quite all right.

17
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:39,810
- I must go up and wait for him.
- But there's nobody in, ma'am.

18
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,938
Well, you say that he isn't in.

19
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,109
But you're not sure, are you?
I'll go upstairs then.

20
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:47,652
As long as I'm here,
I want to see his apartment.

21
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,780
But I can phone the apartment.
I'll call up in front of you.

22
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:53,621
If nobody answers,
I can take the message.

23
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,627
Your name, please?

24
00:05:57,597 --> 00:05:59,588
What's your name, please?

25
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:05,929
You hear it ringing?
Nobody's in the apartment.

26
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,872
Look, I've got a better idea.

27
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,707
You give me the key
to the apartment.

28
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,941
I'll wait till he returns
and give him a real surprise.

29
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:19,348
I was just thinking.
I haven't been here very long...

30
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,580
and I don't even know
if they'll keep me on.

31
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:25,022
But maybe we don't mean
the same person.

32
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:28,389
- Mr. Bliss is a tall redhead, right?
- Yes, that's right.

33
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:33,790
I was afraid of that.
He didn't leave the key.

34
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,498
I guess he took it with him.
Sorry, ma'am. I'm very sorry.

35
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,722
Mr. Bliss, just a second.
A woman was asking for you.

36
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:08,596
- Mrs. Bujol? She and I are finished.
- No, not her.

37
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:11,967
This woman has never been here before.
She wanted me to give her your key.

38
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:15,201
And she even tried to bribe me
with a hundred francs.

39
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:16,932
Really?

40
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,778
It wasn't that little Annie, was it?

41
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:25,240
- No.
- Then it was Big Bertha.

42
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,752
- No. I know those two women.
- Tell me about it then.

43
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,375
Hello. Did I wake you?

44
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,644
It was time for me to get up anyhow.

45
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:01,278
- What's new?
- Nothing special.

46
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:04,915
- I hoped you would answer "Gilberte."
- I don't see why.

47
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:08,427
It's very simple.
Question: What's new? Answer: Gilberte.

48
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,018
You did say she was brand new,
didn't you?

49
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:12,621
You and your humor,
you murder me.

50
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:15,360
So you're going to put
the yoke on today?

51
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,403
And what's this?

52
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:21,031
Better get rid of it
before Gilberte discovers it.

53
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:24,543
Since I broke up with that Bujol woman,
I've been living like a monk.

54
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,512
I also broke with little Annie.
Gilberte's marrying a new man.

55
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:32,347
You know my motto. "Don't run after
women. But don't let any get by."

56
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:35,146
And I wanted to ask Gilberte
to choose a maid of honor...

57
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,985
who won't be too...
who will be kind of...

58
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:39,718
You know what I mean.

59
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,692
It's about time you calm down.

60
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:43,695
"When you've seen one,
you've seen them all."

61
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:46,789
- You taught me that.
- But I want them all.

62
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,232
Women, that's all you think about.

63
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:52,430
You'll have to give up this hobby
some day... with age.

64
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:55,065
That's simple.
I've thought about that day quite often.

65
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,735
I'll use Hemingway's way out...
bang, bang.

66
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,744
My own way out is called "Gilberte."

67
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:03,339
You can't believe that I'm in love?
Go into my bedroom...

68
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,010
and right by the bed,
you'll find a tape recorder.

69
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:08,553
- I see it.
- Good. Press the red button.

70
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:10,714
- The red button?
- Yes.

71
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:15,392
Just listen to that.

72
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:19,391
Terrific, isn't it?

73
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:22,059
Go back to the start.

74
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:34,109
I taped Gilberte crossing her legs.

75
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,205
She didn't know what I was up to.

76
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,740
Listen to the sound of her stockings
rubbing against each other.

77
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:41,676
How do you like it?

78
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,654
That's the sound of nylons.
The first time I tried it...

79
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:48,250
Gilberte was wearing a pair
of silk stockings. Result: Nothing.

80
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,755
I wonder what she's doing right now.

81
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:53,389
With whom, you mean?

82
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:58,096
You're envious, you traitor.
But you'll never make me doubt her.

83
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,198
No, I'm sure she must be gazing
tenderly at my photo.

84
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,841
And I'll bet she's looking
at her naked body in a mirror.

85
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,244
You're crazy.

86
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:11,181
I'm sure of it.
In every novel written by a woman...

87
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,083
the heroine looks at herself naked
in a mirror.

88
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,986
Gilberte's not in a book, though.
What's the relation?

89
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,388
Sexual relation.

90
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,256
Well, I better answer.

91
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:25,525
I'm sure it's Gilberte. Tell her I'm out
of the bath and on my way.

92
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:29,864
<i>Hello. Am I speaking to Mr. Bliss?</i>

93
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,665
Mr. Bliss is in, but...

94
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:42,308
It wasn't Gilberte, but another woman.
She hung up, though.

95
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:43,609
A wrong number?

96
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:46,151
No. She asked for you, then hung up.

97
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:50,448
Yes, it is odd. I'll bet
that must be my secret admirer.

98
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,553
Yes. There's a mysterious lady
who admires me in secret.

99
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,493
It seems that some beautiful woman
tried to enter my apartment...

100
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:01,260
and even offered Charlie the doorman
a hundred-franc note.

101
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:05,300
Which he refused, I suppose.
I'd have let her in for half that.

102
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:09,865
No, it must be a poor pregnant girl
wanting an explanation.

103
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:12,604
- Impossible. She never saw me.
- How do you know?

104
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:16,637
Charlie gave her a description of me
that was completely false.

105
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:19,116
The trap worked.
She said it was definitely me.

106
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:21,278
He said you were handsome
and distinguished?

107
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:22,719
Go ahead and laugh.

108
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:24,949
But he says she was superb.
Know what she wore?

109
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:27,993
An evening gown at 10 A.M.
Let's go.

110
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,687
Yeah, let's go.

111
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:33,163
Your unknown lady is a hotel thief,
that's all.

112
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:36,565
Did you ever see one wearing
an evening gown? If I find her...

113
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:38,899
I'll celebrate
the end of my bachelorhood with her.

114
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:42,202
- See what I mean, you...
- That must be Gilberte.

115
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:49,915
- Too late, a hang-up.
- Your mysterious woman again?

116
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:53,975
If it is, she wants something.
And she wants it bad.

117
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:45,663
And the best man?
Can't the best man kiss the bride?

118
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,103
I'll borrow my daughter,
with your permission.

119
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,977
Do you see what I see
by the door, Bliss?

120
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:00,309
- Well, introduce me.
- But I don't know her.

121
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:02,479
I guess she came here
with Fred and his friends.

122
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:04,580
I'm going to check up, then.

123
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:15,827
- You don't recognize me?
- No. Yes, yes, sure.

124
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:18,530
Excuse me, please.
How are you?

125
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:22,563
If you recognize me, why do you
never say hello to me on the street?

126
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:24,404
Excuse me.

127
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:27,068
Well, I give up. Fred doesn't know her.
Nobody knows her.

128
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:30,240
- She keeps looking at you.
- I have a secret admirer, too.

129
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,483
Boy, my move.

130
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:38,682
- You happy?
- Of course.

131
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:40,952
- Sure you're happy?
- Of course, I am.

132
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:44,086
- Mama is very happy.
- Then we're all happy.

133
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:46,563
You don't look happy.

134
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:53,197
It's my honor to present
the real master of the house.

135
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:55,968
My friend, Bliss.
I can't make the introduction...

136
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:00,034
because Mrs., or perhaps Miss...

137
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,710
...doesn't want to say her name.
She's an apparition.

138
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:08,651
Whatever her name, she's welcome here.
How do you do, apparition?

139
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:11,952
I suppose an apparition
doesn't eat, smoke, or drink.

140
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:15,323
May I have some water?
Cold water, please.

141
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:18,960
<i>I think it would have a better taste
if you got it for me.</i>

142
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,625
That puts me one up on you,
my friend.

143
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,066
I wanted to be alone with you.

144
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:30,141
- That puts me one up on him.
- It's warm here. Take me to the balcony.

145
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:46,084
- Do we know each other?
- Perhaps.

146
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:51,186
- Where did we meet then?
- Think about it.

147
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:53,688
Thank you.

148
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:01,269
May I have another one?

149
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:06,371
Of course.

150
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:14,542
Won't you tell me your name
now that we're alone?

151
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,521
- My name? No.
- Oh, there goes your scarf.

152
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:21,218
You'll permit me to buy you
another one, won't you?

153
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:24,558
Well, you see...
this one was a souvenir.

154
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:28,030
I can't lose it.
It means a lot to me.

155
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,833
You know you are...
I find you fascinating.

156
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:38,009
You intrigue me.
My fiancÈe is lovely.

157
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:43,548
Tell me just one thing.
Did you phone me twice this morning?

158
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:46,676
I don't know.
Get my scarf.

159
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:50,051
Get my scarf, and I will answer.

160
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:04,796
I'm Julie Kohler!

161
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,260
Oh, ma'am. You want Mr. Coral?

162
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:25,064
No, I came to see a friend.
But she's not in.

163
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:27,799
I was trying to leave,
but with all these corridors...

164
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:30,967
I guess I lost my way.
Then I saw this open door.

165
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:36,009
I've always believed you can know
what a person's like...

166
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,743
if you just examine the room
he lives in.

167
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:40,546
Yeah.

168
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:43,816
- I don't know your mister...
- Mr. Coral.

169
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:49,691
Mr. Coral, but let me show you.
I'm sure that he's a messy person.

170
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:54,455
- And I'm sure he isn't rich.
- You're right about that.

171
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,229
He's always at least three months
behind in his rent.

172
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:59,532
He's also a man
who won't face reality...

173
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:03,371
- but takes refuge in dreams.
- That's right.

174
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:08,274
What he's looking for
is an ideal woman...

175
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:11,316
a woman he can't find
and who exists...

176
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,408
- only in his imagination.
- You're right.

177
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:16,249
I've noticed that whenever
the poor man looks at a woman...

178
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:20,417
he gets white as a sheet
or red as a lobster.

179
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:24,361
You see. A simple room like this
can tell you a lot.

180
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:25,726
You're right about that.

181
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,527
But don't let me keep you
from your work.

182
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,097
Good-bye.

183
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:45,546
Mr. Coral,
what about your letter?

184
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:49,314
- I don't think it's for me.
- Yes, it is. It's for you.

185
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:56,024
That's right, it's for me.
Mr. Coral, that's me.

186
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:19,112
"Municipal Theater.

187
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,319
The Fontanarosa."

188
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,630
Very strange.

189
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:58,939
I have a ticket.
Is it good for tonight?

190
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:02,509
Of course, sir. The performance
just began three minutes ago.

191
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:05,078
- You're in box eight.
- Thanks.

192
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:08,155
Your ticket, please.

193
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:12,059
Thank you.

194
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:15,492
This way, please.

195
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:27,131
- You owe me an explanation.
- Do I?

196
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:29,898
Yes, and to begin with,
how do you know me?

197
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:32,933
- You're much too curious.
- My name is Coral, Robert Coral.

198
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:35,336
Am I the man you meant
to send the ticket to?

199
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:37,568
Yes, Robert Coral.

200
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,145
If it were all a mistake,
would you be disappointed?

201
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:45,240
Yes, no, I don't think so.
At least we met.

202
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:48,013
I'm happy
even if it wasn't meant for me.

203
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:53,255
If you were to tell me you won't
see me again, I would feel lost.

204
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:56,624
You're not sorry you came, are you?
Then you're glad?

205
00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:58,356
More than glad.
I'm overwhelmed.

206
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,762
- But I can't stop thinking...
- Yes, I know.

207
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,323
It's difficult to keep from thinking.

208
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:10,734
- Then why don't you tell me?
- It's my secret.

209
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,302
- Your name at least.
- I'll tell you later.

210
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,575
When?

211
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:21,283
- The next time we meet.
- When?

212
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:24,481
I don't know yet.
Next week perhaps.

213
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:27,953
- Why couldn't it be tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

214
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:31,860
Wonderful! Where?

215
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:35,731
Where? At your place?

216
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,064
My place?
But I'd never have dared propose it.

217
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:41,503
Well, dare.

218
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,903
- Would you come tomorrow to my place?
- Gladly.

219
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,070
- You'll tell me everything?
- Yes, I'll tell you...

220
00:26:48,146 --> 00:26:51,980
when, where, why, and how.

221
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,883
- And now, good-bye till tomorrow.
- I'll take you home first.

222
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:59,856
No, you must go.
Until tomorrow night at nine.

223
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,889
I don't know what to say,
I'm just...

224
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:09,462
- Then don't say anything. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

225
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,876
<i>And yet for not even a minute
Did she try to be pleasing</i>

226
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:33,123
I'm wrong.
She did try to be pleasing.

227
00:28:28,913 --> 00:28:30,744
The curtains...

228
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:34,742
There.

229
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,197
The mountain.

230
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:15,325
The mountain.

231
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:21,629
Under the bed.

232
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:26,760
Yes, yes.
Just a second. There.

233
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:40,047
The rent notice.
I guess you passed without seeing it.

234
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:42,780
Oh, just get out!

235
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:01,669
Yes?

236
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,383
You know, I was beginning to think
you wouldn't come at all.

237
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:22,221
You're sweet, but you know...

238
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:25,990
I was sure you would say
something stupid.

239
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:30,090
You're rather hard on me.

240
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:32,500
But I don't mind much.

241
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,367
Which do you prefer,
whiskey or gin?

242
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:38,739
- I warn you, the gin isn't too good.
- No, wait.

243
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,344
I've brought something very special
for the two of us.

244
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:47,175
Arak?

245
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:49,277
It's from the end of the world.
Do you know it?

246
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:51,948
- What? The end of the world?
- Why, no. Arak.

247
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:55,584
Give it to me. Thanks.

248
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,721
- Do you like mandolin?
- Sure I do, why?

249
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:03,699
Because I brought a record
I really love.

250
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:07,329
- I want to listen to it with you.
- Sure.

251
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,839
The record player's there.

252
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:13,867
Put your record on.
I'll open this bottle.

253
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:26,349
- I don't know how to work it.
- Just a minute. I'll get it going.

254
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:42,299
- Permit me to make an impossible wish.
- Why impossible?

255
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:46,173
- Because I'm rather a pessimist.
- I've heard it said:

256
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:48,542
"There are no optimists
or pessimists.

257
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:51,605
There are only happy idiots
or unhappy ones."

258
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,913
Yes, well,
I'm an unhappy idiot then.

259
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:58,388
You cheered me up, though,
so here's to you and me.

260
00:31:59,257 --> 00:32:01,157
The two of us, together.

261
00:32:07,365 --> 00:32:10,732
- Can we have some music?
- Of course.

262
00:32:30,688 --> 00:32:32,383
That's very nice.

263
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:35,348
I don't believe I know it.

264
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:38,953
Look, it's empty.
You know what they say?

265
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,692
"I empty my glass when it's full.

266
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,495
And when it's drained,
I'm full."

267
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:48,997
You remember the secret?

268
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,138
You were to tell me it tonight.

269
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:56,308
I want to know
your deepest thoughts.

270
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:59,441
No, my thoughts are mine.

271
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:02,118
You will know the secret.

272
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:04,780
But wait, it's a bit too early.

273
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:08,758
Aren't you happy here with me?

274
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:12,489
Yes, I am, yes! You are magic.

275
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:18,767
You made me drink a love potion.

276
00:33:19,304 --> 00:33:23,673
Look. I've made this to remind me
of something I should do, but what?

277
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:25,902
- I feel like dancing.
- Good. Let's dance.

278
00:33:25,977 --> 00:33:29,435
No, by myself,
but I'll dance for you.

279
00:33:29,514 --> 00:33:32,608
Listen here. It's the allegretto.

280
00:33:34,485 --> 00:33:37,181
<i>- You're beautiful. Too beautiful.
- But why too?</i>

281
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:39,849
- Too beautiful for me.
- Don't be foolish.

282
00:33:39,924 --> 00:33:41,949
Don't put yourself down.

283
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:45,120
In life you must always play to win.

284
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:48,063
Losers are made, not born.

285
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,823
You're right.

286
00:33:52,937 --> 00:33:55,428
I won't put a hand on you.
You're my fairy princess.

287
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,199
My impossible dream.

288
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:06,611
I won't put a hand on you,
but I wish you'd ask me to touch you.

289
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:10,120
That way I'd know deep down
I could have done it, if I'd wanted to.

290
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:18,458
You're here with me.
It's a miracle.

291
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,066
Till now,
I've had little to do with women.

292
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:28,198
I've been a very lonely soul.

293
00:34:30,575 --> 00:34:34,170
I'll confess something
that I can't tell to a man.

294
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,210
I'll bet I could count
on the fingers of one hand...

295
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:39,943
no, let's say both hands...

296
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:44,546
the women I've had.

297
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:49,820
And now my impossible dream...

298
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:52,390
of making you happy.

299
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:55,395
You've almost done it.

300
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,802
This isn't the first time
we've met, you know.

301
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:07,577
I know that. I met you last night.

302
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:11,507
No, that wasn't the first time either.

303
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:20,051
Listen to me.
No, a little while more.

304
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:22,118
We know each other.

305
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,719
You saw me once.

306
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:27,293
Not too many years ago.

307
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:30,359
But I wasn't wearing black,
I was wearing white.

308
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:13,107
Yes, by God, I recognize you.
You're the bride.

309
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:20,182
Listen, it wasn't our fault.

310
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:23,718
I can't see very well.
Is the light flickering?

311
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,223
Nothing has happened to it.
It's you.

312
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:30,386
I'm being torn to shreds.
You must call a doctor.

313
00:37:30,454 --> 00:37:34,413
It's no use. He'd get here too late.
It's all over now.

314
00:38:33,684 --> 00:38:35,652
Cookie!

315
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:30,599
Hello, Cookie. Such a big ball
for such a little fellow.

316
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:33,569
- How old are you?
- Almost five and a half.

317
00:40:33,637 --> 00:40:36,470
Isn't that nice?
And whose little boy are you?

318
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,100
- I'm my papa's and mama's boy.
- What's your papa's name?

319
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:41,508
- ClÈment.
- ClÈment? ClÈment Morane?

320
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:45,845
- Why, sure. ClÈment Morane.
- You've got a Band-Aid.

321
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:49,943
It was my teacher who put it on
when I fell down in the yard.

322
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,421
- Do you want to play a little game?
- What kind?

323
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:57,359
You put everything you have
in your pockets in my hand.

324
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:09,096
A coin...

325
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:12,203
and a stick of chalk.

326
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:14,538
Fine, be a good boy,
close both eyes...

327
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:18,013
and without peeking,
tell me what I have in my hand.

328
00:41:18,649 --> 00:41:22,312
A marble, a car, a picture...

329
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:26,015
a whistle, chalk.

330
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,391
A coin.
You see, my grandma gave me it.

331
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:36,024
That's pretty good! Now, tell me,
does Grandma live here with you?

332
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,694
Don't you know that grandmas
live someplace else?

333
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:41,135
My grandma lives in Andeville.

334
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:44,470
- Would you like to go to see her?
- You mean, now?

335
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,169
Here. Would you like one of these?

336
00:41:49,013 --> 00:41:51,948
Cookie, come here.

337
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:11,596
MOTHER VERY ILL

338
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:34,220
What are you crying for?

339
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,191
Get a grip.

340
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,627
You knew it would happen sooner or
later. Your mother's no spring chicken.

341
00:42:39,697 --> 00:42:42,188
You might be a little more
sympathetic. A poor sick lady...

342
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:45,394
- alone in that big house, at her age.
- Alone, my eye. She's got a TV set.

343
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:48,632
<i>The world could still function
without a woman that old.</i>

344
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:51,402
I'm worried about how
the two of you will make out.

345
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:55,002
- Lucienne will cook the dinner.
- But Tuesday is her day off.

346
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,344
<i>Your mother would choose
Tuesday to get sick.</i>

347
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:03,184
Do you think you can get along
without me then?

348
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:06,189
Does a man need a Ph.D.
To wipe a kid's nose?

349
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:16,755
- You're not hungry, are you?
- Yes, I am hungry.

350
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:22,401
Now, where's that package of soup?

351
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:32,344
"Gives you soup, thick and velvety,
like mother used to make."

352
00:43:35,052 --> 00:43:38,681
- Cookie, how are things in school?
- Everything's fine, Papa.

353
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:41,452
That's surprising.
Who'll get the star this month?

354
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:44,221
- I think JosÈ Macias.
- The Spanish boy?

355
00:43:44,295 --> 00:43:46,729
He told me he can't speak
any Spanish.

356
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:49,823
The boy may not speak it,
but his father does.

357
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:53,232
Try to get the star back next month.

358
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:55,238
You see, life is like a big race.

359
00:43:55,306 --> 00:43:57,934
Someone has to win,
and someone has to lose.

360
00:43:58,008 --> 00:44:01,102
I know, like Bertrand.
He's my best friend.

361
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:03,669
Next month, you better...

362
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:05,544
I'll get it.

363
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,014
Hello, Cookie.

364
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:11,783
Good evening, sir.
Mr. Morane, I suppose?

365
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:15,484
- Yes. My wife isn't in.
- I know that. I'm Miss Becker.

366
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,359
- Your son, Cookie, is in my class.
- Yes, Miss Becker. I know.

367
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,991
Mrs. Morane didn't really ask me
to come by, but she sounded worried...

368
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:26,366
about leaving you alone with the boy.
I could cook you something...

369
00:44:26,437 --> 00:44:29,133
- and then put Cookie to bed.
- That's really nice of you.

370
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:33,472
But I can take care of things.
I even started making soup.

371
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:36,069
You've made enough to last a week.
Let me do it.

372
00:44:36,146 --> 00:44:39,582
- I think I'll do better.
- Well, if you insist.

373
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,746
Cookie, you haven't said
good evening to Miss Becker.

374
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:46,312
- It's not Miss Becker.
- Cookie, don't make me angry.

375
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:48,688
- She's not my teacher.
- Would you like this?

376
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:51,284
No, don't. He isn't used
to seeing me outside of school.

377
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:54,463
- What's this?
- My whistle.

378
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:58,661
I took it away from you today.
You were so noisy. I'll give it back.

379
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:02,402
- And this, who put on this Band-Aid?
- Miss Becker.

380
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:04,737
You mean it was me.

381
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:08,470
- No. You don't look like her a bit.
- I know what's the matter.

382
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:11,173
It's the glasses.
I wear glasses in school.

383
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:15,444
- There. Well, is this better?
- No. You are not her.

384
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:21,556
- Where's my candy?
- I ate it up!

385
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:24,386
- I'll give you a hand.
- No, please don't bother.

386
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:26,292
But I have to show you
where things are.

387
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:29,821
No, I'll find them.
Go read your newspaper.

388
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:40,571
Do you know where
Daddy's slippers are? Go and get them.

389
00:45:44,081 --> 00:45:47,983
- All right, finish your yogurt.
- I don't like yogurt.

390
00:45:48,552 --> 00:45:52,716
You say you don't like it,
but maybe it doesn't like you.

391
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:56,249
- Yes, it does.
- You have the patience of a saint.

392
00:45:56,326 --> 00:45:58,487
I'll give you some sugar.

393
00:45:58,562 --> 00:46:02,123
I'm puzzled over something.
May I ask a question?

394
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:06,260
Tell me on exactly what basis
you award the star...

395
00:46:06,336 --> 00:46:10,170
- what's the criterion?
- Well, you know...

396
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,401
I don't mind if that boy,
JosÈ Macias, got it...

397
00:46:12,476 --> 00:46:15,001
I just wanted to know.

398
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:19,943
You know, it's all based...
it's based on the grades.

399
00:46:20,017 --> 00:46:23,043
But I was told there are
no grades in kindergarten.

400
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,782
Well, they aren't official.

401
00:46:26,356 --> 00:46:31,885
Cookie, how about it?
It's bedtime. Put on your pajamas.

402
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:49,572
You know, the star.
I never got one, but...

403
00:46:49,746 --> 00:46:52,271
Nothing was preventing me, but...

404
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:56,819
I spent more time under
the teacher's desk than in my seat.

405
00:46:58,522 --> 00:47:02,618
- Can a woman keep a secret?
- You must decide that.

406
00:47:03,327 --> 00:47:07,525
Yes, well. Nobody knows this,
not even the boy's mother.

407
00:47:07,598 --> 00:47:10,590
Yielding to pressure from my friends,
I intend to become...

408
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:13,534
the party's candidate
in the next elections.

409
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:16,596
- I suppose I should wish you luck.
- I won't count my chickens...

410
00:47:16,673 --> 00:47:19,437
but I do think the situation
is favorable.

411
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,412
- Would you like coffee, Mr. Morane?
- No, I prefer a light tea.

412
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:26,274
You see, the people here
must wake up.

413
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,842
They are going to be given a choice,
and they had better choose right.

414
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,787
Do you know the composition
of the district?

415
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:36,155
- Politics and me, you know...
- You're not a non-voter, are you?

416
00:47:36,226 --> 00:47:38,217
- Not me, not at all, but...
- Mark my words.

417
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:41,731
If you don't attend to politics,
politics will attend to you.

418
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:45,929
Personally, I've given up
everything for politics.

419
00:47:46,003 --> 00:47:49,234
Even hunting.
It's no great sacrifice.

420
00:47:49,306 --> 00:47:52,469
So many fools
go hunting these days.

421
00:47:52,676 --> 00:47:56,009
Now, let me tell you this.
Politics is not child's play.

422
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,606
Get this straight, to run a modern
campaign like we're planning...

423
00:47:59,683 --> 00:48:02,550
money's needed, a lot of money,
and we've got it.

424
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:05,645
Sure, people always ask questions,
"Where does it come from?

425
00:48:05,722 --> 00:48:08,213
Who pays for the posters,
hand bills and so forth?"

426
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:11,625
We can't tell them.
They wouldn't understand.

427
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:16,789
Yes, the voters should be completely
informed, but that's just not possible.

428
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:21,332
They don't really know
what's good for them.

429
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:25,334
This evening you were good for us.

430
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:27,377
I really don't know how to thank you.

431
00:48:27,444 --> 00:48:30,743
I have no idea how
I'd have gotten along without you.

432
00:48:31,048 --> 00:48:34,677
My wife will be very grateful to you.

433
00:48:35,586 --> 00:48:39,078
My activities have prevented me
from going to P.T.A. meetings...

434
00:48:39,156 --> 00:48:43,286
but I am acquainted
with your principal.

435
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,818
He'll never set the world on fire,
but he's a good man.

436
00:48:48,232 --> 00:48:50,792
Could you find out if he's decorated?

437
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:53,893
I could see about getting a plaque
for him.

438
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:58,408
It might please him,
and it would help my boy.

439
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:07,078
Come along, Cookie,
you have to go to bed.

440
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:16,892
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
- Yes.

441
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,224
<i>Then I'll be it.</i>

442
00:49:19,896 --> 00:49:22,990
Good. And I'll count to ten. Ready.

443
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:27,002
One, two, three, four, five...

444
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,439
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

445
00:49:35,078 --> 00:49:38,673
Where can Cookie be?
I don't see him.

446
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:43,385
But I hear him nearby.
I'm sure that he's not far.

447
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:50,425
<i>There you are.
Now you're "it."</i>

448
00:49:51,295 --> 00:49:54,628
- You scared me.
- Do you mean it? I scared you?

449
00:49:54,698 --> 00:49:59,397
- No, not really. You go hide.
- Start counting.

450
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:03,166
One, two, three...

451
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:09,110
four, five, six...

452
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,973
seven, eight...

453
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:18,713
nine, ten.

454
00:50:35,706 --> 00:50:38,402
Come on. Up you go.

455
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:43,240
You're too heavy for me.
Say good night to Daddy.

456
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:46,009
- Good night, Cookie.
- Good night.

457
00:50:48,685 --> 00:50:50,516
And say your prayers.

458
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:58,958
Now get ready to meet the sandman.

459
00:51:00,597 --> 00:51:03,122
Get your feet under.

460
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:08,169
Give me your hand
and I'll show you something.

461
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,504
You see, there were five little pigs...

462
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:13,509
and they all lived together.

463
00:51:13,577 --> 00:51:17,445
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.

464
00:51:17,514 --> 00:51:20,813
This little piggy had some roast beef,
this little piggy had none.

465
00:51:20,884 --> 00:51:25,218
And this little piggy cried
"wee-wee-wee" all the way home.

466
00:51:25,288 --> 00:51:29,952
- There! Good night, now. Sleep well.
- Good night.

467
00:51:55,385 --> 00:51:59,151
I went to sleep,
dreaming I was in a movie.

468
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:04,056
My wife must have arrived
at her mother's by now.

469
00:52:04,227 --> 00:52:08,323
Don't leave yet.
Won't you have a liqueur?

470
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:10,093
Sorry, I must go.

471
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:13,159
All that counts is Cookie.
Me, I'm nothing.

472
00:52:13,236 --> 00:52:16,330
You know, I may not look like
a Don Juan, but as a general rule...

473
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:19,432
politicians make it big with women.

474
00:52:19,509 --> 00:52:22,171
It's normal
because a woman can say...

475
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:26,375
"For an hour, he completely forgot
France and gave himself to me."

476
00:52:27,884 --> 00:52:30,375
Please, it's impossible for you
to leave in this weather.

477
00:52:30,454 --> 00:52:31,944
I must go.

478
00:52:32,022 --> 00:52:34,855
Wait, take this umbrella.

479
00:52:35,025 --> 00:52:37,459
Return it to my wife.
She'll want to thank you.

480
00:52:37,527 --> 00:52:39,358
No, thanks.

481
00:52:40,897 --> 00:52:45,300
She's a perfect mother, but she
can't seem to understand me at all.

482
00:52:45,368 --> 00:52:48,132
You seem to understand me
quite well.

483
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:55,508
I've lost my ring. I guess it must've
fallen off while we were playing.

484
00:52:58,048 --> 00:53:00,710
It's a souvenir, a man's signet ring.
It's not worth much...

485
00:53:00,784 --> 00:53:04,880
but I do prize it.
I may have lost it upstairs.

486
00:53:06,957 --> 00:53:09,448
- I'm sure he'll wake up now.
- Don't worry about him.

487
00:53:09,526 --> 00:53:11,687
He'd sleep through an earthquake.

488
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:15,561
But the closet could be a good place
to look. You hid there.

489
00:53:27,711 --> 00:53:31,670
Miss Becker, open the door, please.
It slammed shut.

490
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:33,579
No, I slammed it.

491
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,709
All you have to do is
pull the bolt toward you.

492
00:53:35,785 --> 00:53:39,778
But you haven't understood me.
I'm the one who locked you in.

493
00:53:40,323 --> 00:53:42,689
Open up, Miss Becker!

494
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,253
All right, stop it.
I'll tell you why I did it.

495
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:49,594
- What?
- I'm not Miss Becker.

496
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,362
- What do you mean? Who are you?
- I'm Julie Kohler.

497
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:56,371
David Kohler's widow.
I came here tonight to kill you.

498
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,772
Let me out of here!
Listen to me!

499
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:03,741
Let me explain what happened.
I'll explain the whole thing to you.

500
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,207
<i>It was a terrible accident,
and because of it...</i>

501
00:57:21,277 --> 00:57:24,735
<i>our careers, our futures,
could have been ruined.</i>

502
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:27,647
<i>Bliss, Coral, Delvaux and I
weren't really friends.</i>

503
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:30,185
<i>We were a group of bachelors
in a boring, small town.</i>

504
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:33,245
<i>We'd get together to play cards
and kid around.</i>

505
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:38,753
<i>We only had two common interests.
Hunting and women.</i>

506
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:41,956
<i>After the accident,
we all felt guilty, and yet innocent.</i>

507
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:44,363
<i>We made a quick decision
to break up...</i>

508
00:57:44,434 --> 00:57:47,369
<i>and never see each other again.</i>

509
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:04,309
It's all in the past.

510
00:58:04,383 --> 00:58:07,511
For you it's in the past.

511
00:58:07,586 --> 00:58:09,952
But I live through it every night.

512
00:58:24,603 --> 00:58:27,663
<i>Every young girl dreams of meeting
her Prince Charming...</i>

513
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:30,264
<i>of getting engaged and married.</i>

514
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:34,073
<i>I never had to dream,
because David was always there.</i>

515
00:58:34,146 --> 00:58:38,446
<i>I never looked at another boy,
and no other girl existed for him.</i>

516
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:42,146
<i>I waited for David.
I waited to become his wife.</i>

517
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,259
Julie! Julie!

518
01:00:00,332 --> 01:00:03,893
<i>They wouldn't let me die,
so I went back to the church.</i>

519
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:07,769
<i>The sun was no longer shining.
I stood on the steps...</i>

520
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,830
<i>and turned around
to look at the rooftops...</i>

521
01:00:09,908 --> 01:00:12,206
<i>and when I went into the church...</i>

522
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:15,405
<i>it was not to pray,
it was to make a vow.</i>

523
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,210
<i>I tracked the five of you down,
one by one.</i>

524
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:20,649
<i>It took me a long time to find you.</i>

525
01:00:26,324 --> 01:00:28,849
Let me out! Listen to me!

526
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:31,387
I only listen to David.

527
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:34,193
I told you what happened!
I'll do anything you ask!

528
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:38,828
- I want David.
- I can't breathe!

529
01:00:40,972 --> 01:00:44,806
I only want David, to hear him
laughing, to see him walking.

530
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:46,901
I want to see his eyes.

531
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:50,209
You took something from me,
that you can't give me back.

532
01:01:00,058 --> 01:01:02,356
Are you there?

533
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:05,392
I know you're there, answer me.

534
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:15,370
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

535
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:19,307
Are you there?

536
01:01:23,048 --> 01:01:25,016
What are you doing?

537
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:27,347
What are you doing?

538
01:01:28,453 --> 01:01:31,286
Answer me! What are you doing?

539
01:01:39,097 --> 01:01:41,657
You're mad!

540
01:03:02,914 --> 01:03:05,678
Hello, Cookie. Come with me.

541
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:07,752
Let's talk.

542
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:18,854
Cookie, let's see.

543
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:22,957
You said you played hide-and-seek
with your papa and a lady.

544
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:25,293
What was the lady like?

545
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:29,363
She was funny.
She played a game with us.

546
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:31,500
Did your father hide
under the stairway?

547
01:03:31,576 --> 01:03:33,373
All of us took our turn.

548
01:03:33,445 --> 01:03:35,879
- Who was "it?"
- The lady and me.

549
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:38,541
- What lady?
- The one who was here.

550
01:03:38,616 --> 01:03:41,915
I know, but who was that lady? Who?

551
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,921
I told you.
She's the lady who played with us.

552
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,990
When you played this game
after dinner...

553
01:03:51,062 --> 01:03:52,996
- who was the first to hide?
- Me.

554
01:03:53,064 --> 01:03:54,793
- And then?
- The lady.

555
01:03:54,866 --> 01:03:57,198
- And then?
- My papa.

556
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:00,961
You, the lady, your papa...

557
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,065
- You're angry with her?
- What?

558
01:04:04,142 --> 01:04:06,201
You're angry with Miss Becker?

559
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,580
- What did you say?
- You're angry with Miss Becker?

560
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:12,878
- Who is Miss Becker?
- The lady who came here.

561
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:16,745
The one last night,
her name is Becker?

562
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:18,254
Yes.

563
01:04:18,323 --> 01:04:20,951
Very good.
That's very good, Cookie.

564
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,364
- Miss Becker, please.
- Yes? That's me.

565
01:04:31,436 --> 01:04:34,997
I'm Detective Kling.
Would you come along to the Moranes?

566
01:04:35,073 --> 01:04:37,200
- Right now?
- If you would.

567
01:04:37,275 --> 01:04:39,334
Don't worry about it.
I will see to the children.

568
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:41,971
Thank you. All right.

569
01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:45,313
The poor little boy.
We were just talking about him.

570
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:47,317
I guess they'll ask me
to take care of Cookie.

571
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:50,354
They want to ask you
a few simple questions.

572
01:04:50,422 --> 01:04:53,550
I have to tell the principal.

573
01:04:53,992 --> 01:04:55,289
He's been told.

574
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,225
Don't try to influence the child.

575
01:04:57,295 --> 01:05:00,628
Well, Cookie. Is this she?

576
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,363
Was I the lady, Cookie?

577
01:05:04,436 --> 01:05:10,238
Cookie, was Miss Becker here
when you played hide-and-seek?

578
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:13,140
Yes, Miss Becker was here.

579
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:16,612
And Miss Becker ate
with my papa and with me.

580
01:05:42,073 --> 01:05:46,032
<i>Passengers for Flight 813,
destination Essington...</i>

581
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:51,412
<i>please come to gate B
for immediate boarding.</i>

582
01:05:57,755 --> 01:06:00,417
Excuse me, I forgot something,
I must make a phone call.

583
01:06:00,492 --> 01:06:03,427
You have two minutes.
Please, hurry.

584
01:06:13,204 --> 01:06:15,832
Hello, police? Now listen.

585
01:06:15,907 --> 01:06:19,070
Let that teacher go.
She didn't murder Morane.

586
01:06:19,878 --> 01:06:23,541
I'm talking, not you.
The teacher is innocent.

587
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:27,517
You can believe me because
I'm the murderer. You want proof?

588
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:31,248
I will give it to you. The fake telegram
received by Mrs. Morane...

589
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:33,882
"Mother ill. Must have your help."

590
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:38,554
Cookie's room is upstairs.

591
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,497
And the lamp by his bed
has a lampshade...

592
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:44,865
on which there's a locomotive
racing on the tracks.

593
01:06:44,936 --> 01:06:50,704
Well, is that enough? And now,
let that teacher go. Good-bye.

594
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:05,138
You're wrong
because revenge is wrong.

595
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:08,583
Revenge is hopeless. It would be
endless. It would be necessary...

596
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:12,089
to avenge too many wrongs,
too many crimes, too much ignorance.

597
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,556
The evil thoughts of people.

598
01:08:14,626 --> 01:08:17,652
You must renounce this sinister
mission you've taken on yourself.

599
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:20,698
This must be done, it's not a mission.
It must be done.

600
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:23,962
- Give it up.
- Impossible. I must continue to the end.

601
01:08:24,035 --> 01:08:27,596
I see no remorse in your eyes.
Don't you fear for your soul?

602
01:08:27,672 --> 01:08:29,663
No remorse, no fear.

603
01:08:29,741 --> 01:08:31,800
You know, you'll be caught in the end.

604
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:34,470
The justice of men is powerless.

605
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:38,572
I'm already dead.
I died the same day David did.

606
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,483
I'll join David
after I've had my revenge.

607
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:46,182
How can you hope to join love
through hate and murder?

608
01:08:47,325 --> 01:08:51,762
You have no answer. Not a word.

609
01:08:52,497 --> 01:08:55,227
- I beg you to stop!
- No, you can't sway me.

610
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:58,791
- What were you seeking here?
- The strength to continue.

611
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:01,338
You gave it to me,
in spite of yourself.

612
01:09:01,406 --> 01:09:02,998
Wait!

613
01:09:21,926 --> 01:09:24,520
I was sure of it, boss. I know cops.

614
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:28,554
You fool them two or three times,
then bang, they nab you.

615
01:09:29,567 --> 01:09:32,434
I warned you,
that paint job on the car was bad.

616
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:35,370
I think he did it on purpose,
if you ask me.

617
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:40,502
I tossed the plates into a septic tank.
No one will find them.

618
01:09:40,578 --> 01:09:42,910
I'd hate to be the guy
they send down there.

619
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,574
The cops can't prove a thing
without the plates.

620
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:51,144
The loot.
This is yours, boss, and this is mine.

621
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:56,758
And now, if anyone asks for you,
I don't know a thing.

622
01:09:56,828 --> 01:10:01,197
You said good-bye and left.
I know nothing, see nothing, etc.

623
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:04,098
Customers. I'll get rid of them.

624
01:10:30,695 --> 01:10:33,789
For you, boss. A woman.
She insists on seeing you.

625
01:10:33,865 --> 01:10:36,459
I don't know her.
Looks like a tramp.

626
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:40,095
I'll tell her you're gone,
but she looks stubborn.

627
01:10:54,018 --> 01:10:57,613
Sorry, but Mr. Delvaux is leaving
on a trip and can't see you now.

628
01:10:57,688 --> 01:10:59,849
But if you want me to,
I'll give him a message.

629
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:02,984
That's no good. He's got to see me,
and that's that.

630
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,187
I have time, so I'll just wait here.

631
01:11:05,263 --> 01:11:08,630
Tell him that I'm staying
till he sees me.

632
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:34,481
Mr. Delvaux.

633
01:11:36,828 --> 01:11:39,126
Are you Mr. Delvaux?

634
01:11:39,197 --> 01:11:41,529
Police.

635
01:11:42,099 --> 01:11:44,499
You're under arrest.

636
01:11:46,137 --> 01:11:48,401
Move on.

637
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:50,838
- Is he the one who sold it to you?
- He's the one.

638
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:55,140
Robber! I'll show you yet!
You dirty thief!

639
01:11:55,213 --> 01:11:59,309
Take advantage of me! I'll show you,
you louse! You stinking louse!

640
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:03,214
You won't get away with it!
Dirty rat!

641
01:12:05,723 --> 01:12:10,183
He'll pay for what he did to me!

642
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,807
Driver, 13 Avenue Nemesis.

643
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,712
This is stupid. They were asked
to send a tall, stacked redhead.

644
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:16,149
Good Lord!

645
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:19,053
I was looking all over for you
last year.

646
01:14:19,123 --> 01:14:20,954
Last year?

647
01:14:22,126 --> 01:14:26,256
You're the image of the woman
I needed for my exhibition.

648
01:14:27,999 --> 01:14:31,958
Exactly right for it.
You're a bit too late, though.

649
01:14:32,036 --> 01:14:35,403
This is one more time
that stupid girl got it wrong.

650
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,738
Yes, just right for it. So sorry.

651
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:42,176
But what about me?

652
01:14:42,246 --> 01:14:45,579
I was thrilled to get to model
for the great Fergus.

653
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:48,846
- And besides, I could use the money.
- Well, another time.

654
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:51,979
- Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Wait.

655
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:56,455
Just a second. I may have an idea.

656
01:14:57,228 --> 01:15:00,254
Come on in. Where is that thing?

657
01:15:00,331 --> 01:15:02,799
Oh, here it is.

658
01:15:04,435 --> 01:15:07,302
They've asked me to illustrate a book.

659
01:15:07,371 --> 01:15:09,737
I didn't say no. I didn't say yes.

660
01:15:10,341 --> 01:15:12,707
But now that I see you...

661
01:15:12,777 --> 01:15:17,146
You see, the theme is
Diana the Huntress. It's by Klossowski.

662
01:15:17,214 --> 01:15:22,151
The publisher sent me these things,
a lot of accessories.

663
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:24,016
Look at this.

664
01:15:24,522 --> 01:15:27,320
They got her mixed up with Tarzan.

665
01:15:27,591 --> 01:15:31,721
Well, all right, it's not complicated.

666
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:38,095
The costume, let's say white and short.

667
01:15:38,269 --> 01:15:41,295
Good, you better take care of that.

668
01:15:41,372 --> 01:15:44,671
Take this along. We'll start work
next time you come here.

669
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:48,736
All right?
Have it made at Bertrand's.

670
01:15:49,146 --> 01:15:51,808
- At Bertrand's?
- Yes, Bertrand's, the costume maker.

671
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:55,340
Just tell him it's for me
and that I'm in a hurry.

672
01:15:56,187 --> 01:16:00,283
Mr. Fergus, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I told you a lie.

673
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,552
I was in the agency waiting room
when they told this girl...

674
01:16:05,629 --> 01:16:09,258
to come here to work for you so
I made up my mind to beat her here.

675
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,676
How do you do, Mr. Fergus?
The agency sent me.

676
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:22,906
- The agency? What agency?
- They have guts.

677
01:16:23,013 --> 01:16:26,107
Well... well, you see,
this has happened before.

678
01:16:26,183 --> 01:16:31,280
That stupid woman gets things wrong.
I don't need you. Wait.

679
01:16:32,356 --> 01:16:35,814
- This is for your trouble.
- Oh, no.

680
01:16:36,327 --> 01:16:38,227
Take it. I think I've seen you
somewhere.

681
01:16:38,295 --> 01:16:41,731
Sure, at the Balto,
often with Massoulier.

682
01:16:41,799 --> 01:16:44,029
- That's right. I've noticed you too.
- Have you?

683
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:48,094
What do you say we get together
some evening, but not at the Balto.

684
01:16:48,172 --> 01:16:50,163
I'd love that, Mr. Fergus.

685
01:16:50,241 --> 01:16:53,699
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

686
01:17:03,454 --> 01:17:08,016
There you are.
Now you know, I'm a skirt-chaser.

687
01:17:08,559 --> 01:17:12,893
But don't worry, you're in no danger.

688
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:17,229
Good Lord! I was so busy with the front,
I forgot about the rear.

689
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:26,398
That's thirty-six, twenty-three
and thirty-seven, good.

690
01:17:27,178 --> 01:17:33,083
When I'm in shape, I can tell
a woman's measurements within an inch.

691
01:17:33,417 --> 01:17:35,908
Well, let's get to work.

692
01:17:44,128 --> 01:17:47,586
I'm attracted to that redhead
because she's so vulgar.

693
01:17:47,665 --> 01:17:50,657
I demand lots of vulgarity in my women.

694
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:52,793
It's part of life.

695
01:17:52,937 --> 01:17:56,998
She didn't get the job,
but she got on my list.

696
01:17:57,141 --> 01:18:02,078
I simply must tell you
about my nightmare. Listen to this.

697
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:07,074
It's morning, I'm in the street,
I'm dressed...

698
01:18:07,818 --> 01:18:11,879
and there are only women.
No, there are no women, only men.

699
01:18:12,289 --> 01:18:16,055
So I walk along... only men.

700
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:18,117
Not a single woman.

701
01:18:19,597 --> 01:18:21,497
And then I wake up
in a cold sweat.

702
01:18:21,565 --> 01:18:25,695
But everything's fine,
because it's only a dream.

703
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:29,928
Now listen. I walk around
the neighborhood in the evenings...

704
01:18:30,007 --> 01:18:32,271
and look the girls over in the cafes...

705
01:18:32,343 --> 01:18:35,369
the way that some nuns do
while collecting alms.

706
01:18:35,446 --> 01:18:39,883
"I've collected from that one. That one,
not yet. I'll have to try her."

707
01:18:40,718 --> 01:18:43,949
Your nose is remarkable.
So is your mouth.

708
01:18:44,021 --> 01:18:46,216
If I were a writer, I'd write a book.

709
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:51,753
Every place is the same,
the subway, the train, the bus.

710
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:56,893
I get on, and immediately I look
around to see women I could pick up.

711
01:18:56,967 --> 01:18:59,663
And when I find one,
there's a feeling of relief.

712
01:19:00,204 --> 01:19:03,731
And if there's more than one,
I have a way of grading them.

713
01:19:04,275 --> 01:19:07,176
I don't make a pass
or even give them the eye.

714
01:19:07,244 --> 01:19:09,974
But I know they're there.

715
01:19:10,114 --> 01:19:14,141
And if something occurred,
let's say an accident...

716
01:19:14,218 --> 01:19:17,346
suppose a subway train got
stuck all night between stations...

717
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:19,912
yeah, well, anything might happen.

718
01:19:20,324 --> 01:19:24,590
- Does this shock you?
- No. I'm very interested. Go on.

719
01:19:24,662 --> 01:19:28,063
Anyway, even if I do shock you,
you mustn't move.

720
01:19:28,899 --> 01:19:31,493
I prefer to talk when I work.

721
01:19:31,568 --> 01:19:34,537
Listen. I often get out...

722
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:37,130
and wait on the platform
for the next train.

723
01:19:37,207 --> 01:19:39,698
And you know why? Because there is
no interesting girl in mine.

724
01:19:40,744 --> 01:19:44,908
If I stay, I feel I'm being stifled.
I suffocate.

725
01:19:44,982 --> 01:19:47,610
And you can't imagine
how much I hate contact with men.

726
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:50,711
If a man sits down beside me,
I change my seat.

727
01:19:50,788 --> 01:19:53,552
There. Now you change position.

728
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:02,328
Let's see. Your right leg...
No, not crossed.

729
01:20:02,866 --> 01:20:07,235
Again at the left. Good. Your hands.

730
01:20:10,774 --> 01:20:14,676
Fine. Try to hold it.
Still, I must say...

731
01:20:15,512 --> 01:20:20,415
if I should see too many beauties
in one place or in one day...

732
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:22,645
do you know what happens to me?
I get depressed.

733
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:27,282
I think of those I will miss.
I get dizzy.

734
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:30,460
It happens in the street.
I see a beautiful girl...

735
01:20:30,527 --> 01:20:33,985
walking in front of me,
and my heart beats faster.

736
01:20:34,064 --> 01:20:39,331
I hurry to catch up with her.
I look at her, she's hideous.

737
01:20:40,337 --> 01:20:43,500
Then, believe it or not,
I'm relieved. I find it reassuring.

738
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:49,375
It's crazy.
I've got something to show you.

739
01:20:49,446 --> 01:20:52,677
All right, now.
We're done for today.

740
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:04,018
Look at the date.

741
01:21:04,094 --> 01:21:07,586
- And I'd never seen you in my life.
- It's possible.

742
01:21:11,468 --> 01:21:14,198
This proves what Oscar Wilde said.

743
01:21:14,271 --> 01:21:16,865
That nature imitates art.

744
01:21:17,141 --> 01:21:19,837
- Good-bye, see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

745
01:21:50,908 --> 01:21:53,502
- Hello.
- Hello.

746
01:21:57,681 --> 01:22:01,048
- Who's she?
- You passed her downstairs.

747
01:22:01,118 --> 01:22:04,986
Oh, her. I just saw her back.

748
01:22:05,656 --> 01:22:08,682
I noticed her legs, not great, but nice.

749
01:22:08,759 --> 01:22:11,819
- Her dress was white.
- You're right. That's her.

750
01:22:11,895 --> 01:22:15,695
- Her name is?
- Funny! I forgot to ask her.

751
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:18,460
Where do we eat?
At Titine's or the Customs House?

752
01:22:18,535 --> 01:22:22,130
At Titine's. This is Massoulier's treat.
He won his bet.

753
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:25,175
- What bet?
- On the Montreal-Paris flight.

754
01:22:25,242 --> 01:22:27,608
He succeeded in making the stewardess.

755
01:22:27,678 --> 01:22:31,114
- He won two hundred francs.
- It's worth it.

756
01:22:34,785 --> 01:22:40,519
- Hey, Corey, what is it?
- I'm just sort of thinking.

757
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:42,785
I know I've seen her.

758
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:46,193
As soon as I find a new girl,
somehow you know her...

759
01:22:46,263 --> 01:22:48,823
or if you don't,
you have a friend who does.

760
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:52,665
No, this time it's like having a name
on the tip of your tongue.

761
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:55,161
Has she posed for Massoulier?

762
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:57,469
Frankly,
I don't think she's a real model.

763
01:22:57,541 --> 01:23:01,477
- She gets tired too fast.
- I'm sure that I've seen her.

764
01:23:01,545 --> 01:23:04,275
She's not from around here.
I'd have noticed her.

765
01:23:04,348 --> 01:23:07,647
- Why? Did you...?
- No.

766
01:23:08,886 --> 01:23:12,014
- No, she's different.
- I detest that word.

767
01:23:12,089 --> 01:23:15,684
When you say she's different,
don't forget what the Italians say.

768
01:23:15,759 --> 01:23:19,661
All women are prostitutes.
Except my mother, she's a saint.

769
01:23:20,898 --> 01:23:23,162
Anyway, when you've seen one...

770
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:12,742
- It's you. Good morning.
- Good morning.

771
01:24:12,816 --> 01:24:16,912
- Come in. Do you have the costume?
- Right here.

772
01:24:16,987 --> 01:24:20,946
Great. You can change in the bathroom.

773
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,293
You'd never guess what those are.

774
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:30,925
They're falsies.

775
01:24:31,802 --> 01:24:34,600
Manufactured by a customer of mine,
an American businessman.

776
01:24:34,671 --> 01:24:36,901
He overestimated his sales
possibilities and got stuck...

777
01:24:36,974 --> 01:24:42,037
with eight thousand pair.
So he sells them by the yard.

778
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,842
Amusing, don't you think?

779
01:24:45,415 --> 01:24:48,782
By the way, you didn't tell me
your name yesterday.

780
01:24:49,353 --> 01:24:52,345
- What's your name?
- I don't dare tell you.

781
01:24:52,422 --> 01:24:55,983
- It's such a ridiculous name.
- Ridiculous. Let's hear it.

782
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:58,193
My name is Alphonsine.

783
01:24:58,428 --> 01:24:59,759
Alphonsine!

784
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:01,824
That's a beautiful name.

785
01:25:01,898 --> 01:25:05,664
I like it.
It has the smell of earth about it.

786
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:10,364
Ernestine, Julie, Charlotte.

787
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,932
A lovely name, Alphonsine.
And Alphonsine what?

788
01:25:14,011 --> 01:25:17,469
Just call me Diana. Diana, that's all.

789
01:25:22,753 --> 01:25:24,914
That's not bad.

790
01:25:30,427 --> 01:25:33,487
- May I have your ring?
- Yes.

791
01:25:34,498 --> 01:25:37,524
You may have it back later,
if you're good.

792
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:40,263
But you need a bracelet.

793
01:25:41,505 --> 01:25:45,498
It's not a piece of brass junk.
It's something Calder made.

794
01:25:46,076 --> 01:25:48,670
Yes, on the right.

795
01:25:51,782 --> 01:25:57,778
The girl is fine, the costume
is fine, but from here...

796
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:02,587
you look more like a tennis player
than Diana the Huntress.

797
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:05,958
We'll have to concentrate on detail.

798
01:26:07,698 --> 01:26:10,724
Let's take each thing on its own.

799
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:16,402
Position of the feet,
position of the legs.

800
01:26:17,074 --> 01:26:20,771
And the hand taking an arrow
from the quiver.

801
01:26:20,844 --> 01:26:22,835
Don't move your body.

802
01:27:21,905 --> 01:27:23,702
You must be tired.

803
01:27:23,774 --> 01:27:26,937
Now you may rest a bit.
Like something to drink?

804
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,773
- I would.
- Cool or hot?

805
01:27:28,845 --> 01:27:29,834
Hot.

806
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:32,381
- Do you want tea or coffee?
- Tea. Let me make it, please.

807
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:34,940
- No, you take a rest.
- No, stay here.

808
01:27:35,018 --> 01:27:37,919
I'll do it.
I'd rather move around.

809
01:27:42,459 --> 01:27:44,791
- What happened in your kitchen?
- What?

810
01:27:45,629 --> 01:27:47,722
I mean, what caused this hole?

811
01:27:48,331 --> 01:27:51,789
That? That's a bullet hole.

812
01:27:51,868 --> 01:27:54,268
A cop committed suicide
in the courtyard.

813
01:27:54,337 --> 01:27:57,033
- A cop?
- Yes, a cop. Funny, isn't it?

814
01:27:57,841 --> 01:28:00,639
He shot himself in the head.
Do you know why?

815
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:02,541
Despair over love.

816
01:28:03,413 --> 01:28:05,643
The whole thing was beyond me.

817
01:28:05,715 --> 01:28:08,343
After all, who ever thinks
of a cop being in love?

818
01:28:10,954 --> 01:28:13,514
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing special.

819
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:16,115
- Then, let's have dinner together.
- Absolutely not.

820
01:28:16,193 --> 01:28:17,558
Why not?

821
01:28:17,627 --> 01:28:20,892
Because I came to pose
and when time's up, I leave.

822
01:28:20,964 --> 01:28:23,228
Then we can stop now.

823
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:25,223
We're going to stop?

824
01:28:25,302 --> 01:28:29,238
I'm fed up. Knocked out.
We'll go on tomorrow.

825
01:28:36,913 --> 01:28:39,609
- Three o'clock tomorrow.
- All right.

826
01:28:39,683 --> 01:28:42,516
Will you give me back the ring, please?

827
01:28:42,586 --> 01:28:45,146
You must have a telephone.
Give me the number.

828
01:28:45,222 --> 01:28:48,089
That's impossible. My ring.

829
01:28:51,428 --> 01:28:55,262
I'll hold on to it.
This way, I'll know you'll come back.

830
01:28:55,332 --> 01:28:58,267
All right. So long.

831
01:29:44,314 --> 01:29:48,307
<i>Fergus, how are you? Where have you
been lately? Something wrong?</i>

832
01:29:48,385 --> 01:29:50,945
Nothing special. A little depressed.

833
01:29:51,021 --> 01:29:53,080
<i>The gang's at the Balto.
We'll cheer you up.</i>

834
01:29:53,156 --> 01:29:55,249
No, I'll stay home,
if you don't mind.

835
01:29:55,325 --> 01:29:57,384
<i>I'll bet it's that girl.
Nothing doing?</i>

836
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:01,624
Yes, yes. It's all right.
I'm even spending my nights with her.

837
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:23,542
Are you all right? It's nothing.

838
01:30:24,421 --> 01:30:27,913
How could it happen?
I don't understand.

839
01:30:28,358 --> 01:30:31,486
It's all right, I tell you.
It wasn't your fault.

840
01:30:32,429 --> 01:30:35,660
It was lucky I broke my charcoal.

841
01:30:36,433 --> 01:30:39,732
You're trembling. You're cold.

842
01:30:39,803 --> 01:30:42,294
Wait... I've got an idea.

843
01:30:49,579 --> 01:30:52,776
Both of us are alive.
Let's drink to that.

844
01:30:58,355 --> 01:31:01,882
When I was a boy,
my father would say...

845
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:06,395
champagne is to adults
what milk is to kids.

846
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,771
Do you know why the Chinese
never use this little finger?

847
01:31:24,047 --> 01:31:26,607
Because it's mine.

848
01:31:33,256 --> 01:31:35,622
Good champagne?

849
01:31:39,162 --> 01:31:41,221
Feel better?

850
01:31:41,765 --> 01:31:45,360
You got a shock.
We'll finish tomorrow.

851
01:31:45,468 --> 01:31:47,732
See a movie with me?

852
01:31:47,804 --> 01:31:50,466
And we'll have dinner on the Seine,
on a boat later.

853
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:55,341
- Let's get it over once and for all.
- Then will you promise?

854
01:31:55,412 --> 01:31:58,472
Whatever you want,
but we must finish right away.

855
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,988
Are you all right?

856
01:32:10,527 --> 01:32:12,961
- You sure?
- Yes.

857
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:15,827
Fine, let's go.

858
01:32:23,173 --> 01:32:25,107
Very good.
Now, a little more toward me.

859
01:32:26,176 --> 01:32:28,076
A little more.

860
01:32:30,613 --> 01:32:32,604
That's it.

861
01:32:41,391 --> 01:32:45,054
Damn it, damn it!
It's the weekly stampede.

862
01:32:46,129 --> 01:32:48,120
They're like a cyclone!
We'll have to stop.

863
01:32:48,198 --> 01:32:50,723
I'm going to change.
I don't want to meet them.

864
01:32:51,534 --> 01:32:54,560
Wait! Don't look at me, please.
I have something to tell you.

865
01:32:54,637 --> 01:32:58,129
But keep looking away,
or I'd never be able to.

866
01:32:58,441 --> 01:33:01,171
There are words and expressions
that everyone uses.

867
01:33:01,244 --> 01:33:05,510
They're in all the books.
The phrases I thought I'd never use.

868
01:33:05,748 --> 01:33:08,410
I thought I was above all that.

869
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:12,881
Now, I'm in love with you.

870
01:33:13,456 --> 01:33:16,687
- Don't run away! Do you love me?
- Leave me alone!

871
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:19,785
It's not love I'm looking for.

872
01:33:45,922 --> 01:33:49,358
- Do you know her?
- No. Never saw her.

873
01:33:49,425 --> 01:33:52,053
I'm sure that I've seen
that face somewhere before.

874
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:54,062
I'm going to find out where.

875
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,621
Fergus, well, have you got it made?

876
01:33:56,699 --> 01:33:58,564
Shut up, will you! She's in there.

877
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:03,134
Where? In the bathroom?

878
01:34:09,646 --> 01:34:13,173
Diana The Huntress.
She's a virgin, then.

879
01:34:21,624 --> 01:34:23,285
I've seen her.

880
01:34:27,297 --> 01:34:30,266
- Daniel's making his usual play.
- That's a lot of hypocrisy.

881
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:33,427
Artists, they say, are immoral.
They sleep together and all that.

882
01:34:33,503 --> 01:34:35,630
Yeah, why does everyone
pick on us artists?

883
01:34:35,705 --> 01:34:39,300
You take any field.
Civil service, banks, factories.

884
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:40,808
Take the subway, for instance...

885
01:35:02,966 --> 01:35:05,628
Hey, Daniel,
are you reciting Saint-Simon?

886
01:35:05,702 --> 01:35:07,727
I think we know each other.
My name's Corey.

887
01:35:07,804 --> 01:35:08,736
- And you?
- Diana.

888
01:35:08,805 --> 01:35:10,705
- Diana what?
- That's all.

889
01:35:10,773 --> 01:35:12,570
Where have I seen you?

890
01:35:12,642 --> 01:35:14,633
You looked at me
as if you knew me also.

891
01:35:14,711 --> 01:35:16,702
There are people who don't make
much of an impression.

892
01:35:16,779 --> 01:35:18,337
You did.

893
01:35:21,684 --> 01:35:24,482
I'm imagining you with different hair.

894
01:35:24,787 --> 01:35:27,483
Grandmorin is inviting us all to dinner.
He wants you.

895
01:35:27,557 --> 01:35:30,253
- It'll keep, I guess.
- No, you go and speak to him now.

896
01:35:30,326 --> 01:35:34,228
- We'll be leaving right away?
- I guess we'd better go.

897
01:35:35,298 --> 01:35:37,698
All right?

898
01:35:48,544 --> 01:35:50,637
- You'd like to finish tonight?
- Yes.

899
01:35:50,713 --> 01:35:54,581
Me too. I suggest we go along
with them to the restaurant...

900
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:57,711
and there you say you've got to phone
while I go out the back door.

901
01:35:57,787 --> 01:36:00,347
- We meet here in 20 minutes, all right?
- Yes.

902
01:36:53,609 --> 01:36:55,509
Of course.

903
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:37,541
For three days, I've been trying
to think where I met her.

904
01:38:37,613 --> 01:38:40,810
And then, in the middle of the night,
wham! At Bliss's place.

905
01:38:40,883 --> 01:38:44,182
The night that he got engaged,
when he fell off the terrace.

906
01:38:45,087 --> 01:38:48,989
She was there alone. No one saw
her come, no one saw her go.

907
01:38:49,058 --> 01:38:51,458
No one knew her name or who she was.
Nothing.

908
01:41:03,392 --> 01:41:04,552
Recognize him?

909
01:41:04,627 --> 01:41:07,187
Yes, it's him.
I pushed him off the terrace.

910
01:41:07,263 --> 01:41:09,527
Yes, that's Bliss.
The three of us were together.

911
01:41:09,599 --> 01:41:14,298
To be alone with him, she sent me
for a glass of water, and then...

912
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,302
I never saw him.
I had only met Bliss and Fergus.

913
01:41:21,077 --> 01:41:23,637
Robert Coral.
I came to his hotel and poisoned him.

914
01:41:25,581 --> 01:41:27,412
- Recognize this one?
- I don't.

915
01:41:28,317 --> 01:41:30,751
He was pushed off a train in the night.

916
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:33,812
- We don't know who he is.
- I tell you, I don't know the man.

917
01:41:36,225 --> 01:41:39,956
That's Morane. He suffocated
in a hall closet. I admit I shut him in.

918
01:41:40,997 --> 01:41:42,430
Mr. Corey?

919
01:41:43,933 --> 01:41:46,163
This is the last victim,
your friend, Fergus.

920
01:41:46,235 --> 01:41:50,331
Now, please, tell us why
you killed these men.

921
01:41:50,406 --> 01:41:53,239
I remember something.
You didn't know Bliss...

922
01:41:53,309 --> 01:41:55,504
because at the party
you took me for him.

923
01:41:55,578 --> 01:41:57,773
And you didn't know
Fergus either. Well?

924
01:41:57,847 --> 01:42:00,281
You'll never know.

925
01:42:05,421 --> 01:42:07,981
They must have something in common.

926
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:10,821
Or else...

927
01:42:11,227 --> 01:42:14,890
You'll be examined by a group
of psychiatrists tomorrow, but...

928
01:42:16,032 --> 01:42:21,732
I wonder if the list was closed?
He might have been the next.

929
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:25,800
Yes, I hate him
because he's the sort of man...

930
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:28,173
who's always pawing girls,
but I wouldn't kill him.

931
01:42:28,244 --> 01:42:30,212
What did you have against Bliss
and Fergus?

932
01:42:30,279 --> 01:42:31,507
And Morane and Coral?

933
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:34,071
I've nothing more to say.

934
01:42:36,552 --> 01:42:38,543
Have you chosen a lawyer?

935
01:42:38,621 --> 01:42:40,680
I don't know any, and it doesn't
matter anyway.

936
01:42:40,756 --> 01:42:44,556
Then, we'll assign you one.

937
01:42:44,627 --> 01:42:48,222
I hope he can work out
a better defense for you.

938
01:42:57,506 --> 01:43:00,031
I've known killers caught with
a smoking gun, brazenly refusing...

939
01:43:00,109 --> 01:43:03,078
to admit their crime,
but this one beats all.

940
01:43:03,145 --> 01:43:07,445
She admits committing four murders,
and won't say what the motive was.

941
01:43:09,018 --> 01:43:13,387
I'm stumped by the way this woman,
so intelligent, let herself be caught.

942
01:43:13,456 --> 01:43:16,391
Doesn't make any sense.

943
01:44:44,547 --> 01:44:46,845
Soup's on!

944
01:44:50,886 --> 01:44:53,548
Hey, you!

1
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:27,135
SOFT SKIN

2
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:19,979
Crossing

3
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:42,116
I just called your ofice.

4
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:46,339
The subway broke down,
not a cab in sight.

5
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:47,747
- Hello, Odile.
- Hello, Pierre.

6
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:50,510
- When's plane time?
- I've got 40 minutes.

7
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,679
In this trafic? Never!

8
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,391
- I must try it, Franca.
- I've packed your suitcase.

9
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,715
Hello, daddy!

10
00:01:57,944 --> 00:01:58,685
Hello, princess.

11
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:02,939
- Will you take the car?
- If you come along to park it.

12
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:06,693
Only if you do the driving...
I make you too nervous.

13
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:11,864
It's my husband.

14
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,701
- It's a tie rack.
- Stop kidding.

15
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,577
What's up?

16
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:19,278
Pierre's late.
He's lecturing in Lisbon.

17
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,906
- I can drive you.
- Franca will do it.

18
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,586
Go ahead,
you're a much better driver.

19
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:27,547
That's right, he is.

20
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:32,176
Bye, princess.

21
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:33,667
Bye, daddy.

22
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:35,471
Be good now.

23
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:38,433
Can I ride to the airport?

24
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,226
You know you can't.

25
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:42,895
Why not? She'll enjoy it.

26
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:43,896
Okay, you can come.

27
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:48,526
Mademoiselle, would you get
Sabine's coat, please.

28
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:51,321
Call to tell me
where you are staying.

29
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,323
Here's an article about you.

30
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,491
I'll read it later.

31
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:59,287
Please be careful.
He can always catch another plane.

32
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:17,847
- What's the time?
- It's 3:45.

33
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,892
We'll never make it.

34
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:23,394
Is your talk on Stendhal ?

35
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,188
No, on Balzac.

36
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,490
There's a speed limit
but what the hell.

37
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,995
A cop!
If he's after us, we're sunk.

38
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:46,751
You just leave it to me.

39
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,689
Bye Michel, thanks.

40
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:09,524
- Porter?
- No thanks.

41
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,155
The Lisbon plane,
can I still make it?

42
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,617
I'm not sure...

43
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,414
Mr. Lachenay for the Lisbon flight?

44
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,417
Let me check.

45
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:30,253
They might have taken
the ladder away.

46
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:33,089
Check in Mr. Lachenay's luggage.

47
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:36,175
This way, please. Let's hurry.

48
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,646
They're taking the ladder away.

49
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:52,442
No, it's going back.

50
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:05,538
Let's hurry.

51
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,753
Quick, the door!

52
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,071
Please...

53
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,981
Fasten your seat belt
and no smoking. Thank you.

54
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,499
Seats forward, please.

55
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:26,346
Will you wait here, please?

56
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,726
We can go now.

57
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:38,399
A photo with the stewardess, please.

58
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,086
This way, Mr. Lachenay.

59
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,021
Here's the bathroom.

60
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,345
Fine.

61
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:23,778
Perfect.

62
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,104
For you.

63
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:01,316
BALZAC AND MONEY

64
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:04,861
Why Balzac and Money?

65
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,449
Well, I'm a fan of Balzac's...
and I don't despise money.

66
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:13,161
But all joking aside,
that happens to be

67
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,778
the title of one of my books.

68
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:19,584
How about a book
on Balzac and Love?

69
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,210
Why not?

70
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,297
There's a full house.

71
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:32,972
We'll need some extra seats.

72
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,976
- What's lonesco up to?
- He's doing fine.

73
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:41,314
- We'd better go now.
- I'm ready.

74
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:46,569
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

75
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:55,317
As soon as I am through
with the introduction...

76
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:59,165
I know what to do.
See you later.

77
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:05,213
Ladies and gentlemen...

78
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:11,667
We've got a small problem
with the microphone.

79
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:14,764
I present you Pierre Lachenay.

80
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:24,482
How about lunch tomorrow?

81
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:26,734
Sorry, I leave at noon.

82
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:28,277
What a pity.

83
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,363
Look, it's Pierre Lachenay.

84
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:35,910
We hope to see you in Paris
very soon. Goodbye.

85
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,654
Here's where I get of.

86
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,782
I'll call you.

87
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,273
Yes, tomorrow.

88
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,419
I forgot to ask you your floor...

89
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:37,972
That's quite alright.

90
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,691
I'm sorry.

91
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,269
Thank you, sir.

92
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:51,606
Would you ring room 813?

93
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,025
Hold on.

94
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:01,240
Hello, room 813?

95
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:05,953
Miss, I was in the elevator
with you...

96
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:08,289
I wanted to apologize...

97
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,625
Apologize for what?

98
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:13,378
You got of at the 8th floor...

99
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:15,129
Of course.

100
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:18,341
Well, since I'd past
my floor anyway...

101
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:21,438
and you had so many packages...

102
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,900
I should have helped you with them.

103
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:28,643
Not at all.
That's perfectly alright.

104
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:32,981
Well forgive me...

105
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:36,067
Look, I wonder...
Could we have a drink together?

106
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:37,610
Right now?

107
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,278
Yes, right now.

108
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:41,280
Do you know what time it is?

109
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,158
Oh, it's past 1 a.m.

110
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:46,285
And the bar's closed.

111
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,540
Then, could we have
a drink tomorrow?

112
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,043
There's really no point,
you know.

113
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,004
I see. I'm very sorry...

114
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:00,633
Good night. Please excuse me.

115
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,543
Look, I didn't mean to be so rude.
It was very kind of you to call me.

116
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,962
Let's have that drink together.

117
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:40,923
Fine. In the morning?

118
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:43,926
No, I've got to go shopping.

119
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,888
Can we make it in the afternoon?

120
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,806
Yes, of course.

121
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,424
In the bar at six?

122
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,894
Alright.

123
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:55,480
Good night.

124
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,395
Do you enjoy... your work,
or do you dislike it?

125
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:38,481
I like my job.

126
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,358
I started a year ago.

127
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:43,361
They said I'd soon be fed up.

128
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,935
Maybe.

129
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,449
Many girIs do quit after a few years.

130
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,159
What happens to them?

131
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:52,610
They get married.

132
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:56,874
I love my parents...

133
00:16:57,093 --> 00:17:00,295
They live in Bordeaux.

134
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:02,213
That's where I'm from.

135
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,554
Papa used to say it's a job

136
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:12,932
for a mob,
but now, he doesn't mind.

137
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,395
- Don't you know her?
- Yes, I do.

138
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,982
They're friends of mine.

139
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:24,736
That's Frank. He's the co-pilot

140
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:27,488
of the plane you came on.

141
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:34,996
We almost met six months ago.

142
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:36,289
What do you mean?

143
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:39,751
I knew a TV writer

144
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,711
who worked with Louise de Vilmorin.

145
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,298
She had us to dinner once.
You were expected.

146
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:49,135
We waited, but you never showed up.

147
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:51,429
I just couldn't help it.

148
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:55,016
I haven't read all of your books.
In fact, I haven't read any.

149
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:59,812
But I've seen you on television.

150
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:04,984
So, at the airport,
I recognized you.

151
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:10,323
... so Balzac decides
to put out a novel a month.

152
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:14,744
Not slim ones, mind you,
but huge volumes.

153
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,829
He writes a chapter a day.

154
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:20,906
He can't live on what
the publishers pay him,

155
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:24,379
so he buys his own printing plant.

156
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:26,996
But business is bad

157
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:29,895
and his partners pull out.

158
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:33,638
He decides to do it all by himself,

159
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:36,474
casting his own type,

160
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:38,309
setting it himself,

161
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:42,105
even making his own paper.

162
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:46,943
But he loses everything,
including Mme de Berny's money.

163
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:48,569
Wasn't she his mistress?

164
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:52,115
Yes. I'll tell you
how that came to pass.

165
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:56,567
Mme de Balzac wants
a wife for her son, Honore'.

166
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,081
Mme de Berny has two daughters
to marry of.

167
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,075
Honore' meets the two young girIs,

168
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:06,337
who leave him cold.

169
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:09,121
But he falls in love
with the mother.

170
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,717
That's marvellous!

171
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:16,723
I've been talking for hours.

172
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:18,933
It was fascinating!

173
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:22,395
I'll lend you some books,
if you'd like.

174
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,096
I didn't realize
it was getting so late!

175
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,567
Look how kind these folks are.

176
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:31,560
In France, the boss would have
put us out hours ago.

177
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,949
I'll ask for the bill.
It must be daylight by now.

178
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,318
- A cofee, please.
- Coming, Madame.

179
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:36,839
Matches?

180
00:23:57,597 --> 00:23:59,255
- Surprised?
- A little.

181
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:01,382
It was easy.

182
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:04,302
I called your secretary,
then your Lisbon hotel,

183
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:08,379
checked with the airport
and here I am!

184
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:15,104
Michel and Odile
are coming over later.

185
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:18,399
I knew you'd be tired
but it was only possible today.

186
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,778
They are going to Japan.

187
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:27,481
How does one turn of this heater?

188
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:37,752
I guess we can turn that of.

189
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:42,924
- I hate sports programs.
- So do I.

190
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:47,845
The other day,
on the way back from the airport,

191
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:51,391
my car broke down
on the rue Saint Denis.

192
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,893
What were you doing there?

193
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,770
Tell us all about it.

194
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:58,231
Not rue St Martin, rue St Denis.

195
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,901
I was just going
to the Japanese art shop.

196
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,362
To buy some prints, I suppose.

197
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,239
You guessed right.

198
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,493
I meant to ask you...

199
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,745
- Ice cream?
- Yes, please.

200
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:14,872
... where you stay in Tokyo?

201
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:17,375
The Takanawa Hotel is pretty good.

202
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:19,585
- Listen.
- What is it?

203
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:22,046
That's Sabine.

204
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:23,715
I'll go this time.

205
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,591
Is it your first trip to Japan?

206
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,594
No, I already went there
2 years ago.

207
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:32,724
As soon as you put a cigarette
in your mouth, a woman lights it up.

208
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:40,857
What are you doing?

209
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:46,988
I'm looking for my book.

210
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:50,491
It's late.
You should be fast asleep.

211
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,285
I have slept.

212
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:54,162
Yes, but not enough.

213
00:25:57,509 --> 00:25:59,250
Back to bed, now.

214
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,003
Here.

215
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,547
And here.

216
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:10,178
That's enough, now.

217
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,348
I'm closing the door.

218
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:15,350
Open it more.

219
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:16,559
Is that enough?

220
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:18,050
A bit more.

221
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,438
No more than this.

222
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,231
They're going.
You might at least say goodbye.

223
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,621
So you're of to Tokyo?

224
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,238
Not yet.
They are leaving next month.

225
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,585
See you at Suzanne's tomorrow.

226
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:26,212
Let's go together.

227
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:28,298
We'll see. I'll call you.

228
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:30,883
I can rely on you to call.

229
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:34,387
Have a good trip back.

230
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:35,430
Goodbye.

231
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,773
Were you bored?

232
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:47,317
No, I like them.

233
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:48,776
They're nice.

234
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:53,990
By the way, Kanayan called.
He's furious.

235
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:55,616
Again?

236
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:58,661
What is it this time?

237
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:03,291
It seems
that in the latest edition,

238
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,752
his article was put in last place.

239
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:09,297
He said: ''I know it's petty,

240
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:12,884
""but as I"m from
an underdeveloped country...

241
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:18,462
''I've got
a terrible inferiority complex.''

242
00:28:19,943 --> 00:28:22,644
I felt like quoting that joke...

243
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:26,898
''That's no complex, my dear,
you're really inferior!''

244
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:30,693
But that would be going too far.

245
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:34,687
Once you know him,
he's really a nice guy.

246
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:38,295
pierre LACHENAY, president
5th floor, left

247
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:40,119
pierre LACHENAY, president
5th floor, left

248
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:45,416
- What about that call?
- The line's busy.

249
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:48,878
Can we do the mail now?

250
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:50,296
If you like.

251
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,516
For Mr. Kanayan,
17, street so and so.

252
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:04,018
My dear Kanayan,

253
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:08,439
You're decision
to stop writing for us

254
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:12,568
is due to a misunderstanding...

255
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:16,572
No. I'll lunch with him instead.

256
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,366
- And the other letters?
- Later.

257
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:20,201
What about the calls?

258
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:23,413
I'll take these if they call back.

259
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:24,737
So I'm not calling anyone?

260
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:26,238
No one else.

261
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:29,085
And your appointment?

262
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:31,087
Yes, I remember.

263
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,617
- I'm going out.
- And your appointment?

264
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:02,942
I'll be right back.

265
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:22,513
When you called,
I was on my way out.

266
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:24,390
When's a good time?

267
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:27,685
It's hard to say.
My hours are so crazy.

268
00:30:27,988 --> 00:30:30,688
I lose many friends that way.

269
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:34,359
People invite me,
but they are never sure

270
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:37,695
I'll turn up,
so they stop asking me.

271
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:39,781
Well, I'll never stop.

272
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,691
I'll always be there
whenever you need me.

273
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,411
God, it's windy!

274
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,571
Do you have to go to gym?

275
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,793
It's part of the refresher course.

276
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:53,836
What's that?

277
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:57,799
We practice first aid,
safety drills

278
00:30:58,018 --> 00:31:01,844
and how to handle lifeboats.

279
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:03,930
It's late, I must run.

280
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:32,114
- Guess what I've got!
- Something for me?

281
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:34,085
It's a record.

282
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:36,879
A little girI singing?

283
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:38,965
No, something nicer.

284
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,176
Haydn's Toy Symphony.

285
00:31:42,395 --> 00:31:46,055
You hear toys and birds calls
in the music.

286
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:48,516
Wait and listen.

287
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:01,029
It's lovely.

288
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,541
Where's the paper that was here?

289
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,668
I didn't touch it.

290
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:19,005
It's not here and I need it!

291
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,705
Let's see if it's up there.

292
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:27,055
It had a book review
I meant to keep.

293
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:29,223
I'm sure it's around.

294
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,688
Here it is.

295
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,776
This isn't the one, goddamn it!

296
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:42,153
Calm down.

297
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:44,489
Our news dealer can get it for you.

298
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,699
I want it right now!

299
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:50,745
Is that so?
Well, get your lousy paper yourself!

300
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:33,514
I love You.

301
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,685
Ever since Knowing You,
I"ve become a new man,

302
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,898
one who cannot conceive
of living without You. I love You.

303
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:48,821
Are you coming or going?

304
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:52,742
We take of in half an hour.

305
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:55,912
I'm taking the bus.
Are you coming with me?

306
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,750
Catherine, please,
I've got to see someone.

307
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:03,586
Alright, bye.

308
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,303
You're still here?

309
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:17,684
I saw a plane take of
and assumed you were on it.

310
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:21,135
Lot's of planes take of
from here, you know.

311
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:24,764
They're changing a wheel,

312
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:26,943
so we're delayed.

313
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,537
Are you asleep?

314
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:27,170
You're mean!

315
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:44,687
I'm sorry I carried on so
about that paper.

316
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:48,149
It wasn't that urgent.

317
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:51,569
Besides, I found it
ten minutes later.

318
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:09,076
Let's go away for a few days.

319
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:13,675
We haven't been alone
together for years.

320
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,761
Sabine could stay with Odile.

321
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:19,222
What do you think?

322
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:22,016
A few days in the country?

323
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:25,728
Maybe. We'll see.

324
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:44,998
Hello, Mr. Lachenay.
How is Madame?

325
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:46,457
She's fine.

326
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:08,771
The menu.

327
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:22,201
- Did you wait for me yesterday?
- Yes, you were late.

328
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,442
What happened?

329
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:26,706
A snowstorm in Frankfurt.
I'm sorry.

330
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:30,866
Next time we're held up,
I could cable you.

331
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:32,462
Or call my ofice.

332
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:34,756
What about your secretary?

333
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:36,549
It doesn't matter.

334
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:38,509
I didn't expect you.

335
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:39,552
Glad?

336
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:41,721
Yes, I was feeling blue.

337
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:46,517
Here's a present.
You can use it to make notes

338
00:38:46,736 --> 00:38:48,853
during your lectures.

339
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:50,605
Thank you.

340
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:52,899
I'm most pleased.

341
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:04,233
Can I sleep at your place?
I'm not expected home.

342
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:08,873
Look, I hate to say no,

343
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:11,167
but I'm scared...

344
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:16,255
of the concierge.
Besides, the landlady's

345
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:19,175
an old friend of my parents.

346
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:23,721
No one's ever spent
the night there. We can't.

347
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:26,599
Don't be angry.

348
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:29,185
I want to stay with you, too.

349
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:31,312
I understand.

350
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,806
Why don't we sleep some place else?

351
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:39,362
Alright.
First, I'll pick up a dress.

352
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:42,407
Then, a nice restaurant.

353
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,867
A place where we can dance?

354
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:47,568
Choose a place.

355
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:53,292
I warn you, I don't dance.

356
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:55,628
I never learned how.

357
00:39:56,473 --> 00:39:59,632
Even when you were... I mean...

358
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:02,635
Yes, even when I was young.

359
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:05,836
That made it hard to find a wife.

360
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:07,390
Don't be silly!

361
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:11,936
Go ahead, dance.

362
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:13,563
What will you do?

363
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:15,565
I'll just look at you.

364
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:17,817
That will be my pleasure.

365
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:15,792
LUXURY STUDIOS
Open 24 hours a daY

366
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:49,575
- A room please.
- No reservation?

367
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:54,288
Sorry, not now.

368
00:41:57,886 --> 00:41:59,377
You can go upstairs.

369
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:05,842
But I'll have a room in 15 minutes.
Can you wait?

370
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,177
Fifteen minutes?

371
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:15,528
Please, Pierre, let's go.

372
00:42:15,862 --> 00:42:16,853
Of course.

373
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,664
Disappointed?

374
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:38,750
No, I felt the same way.

375
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:41,586
I'd no idea it would be so sordid.

376
00:42:42,722 --> 00:42:45,089
We need a place of our own.

377
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:48,301
I'll take you home.

378
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:19,551
- I'm of now.
- One more kiss.

379
00:43:28,435 --> 00:43:29,926
Listen.

380
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:33,680
We'll be careful, come on up.

381
00:43:34,024 --> 00:43:34,973
Come.

382
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:54,117
I'll go first.

383
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:57,745
It's too risky.

384
00:43:57,964 --> 00:43:59,747
You'd be worried.

385
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:02,083
There's another way.
When do you leave?

386
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:06,087
In two days. I'll be back Monday.

387
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:11,718
Next week, I've got a lecture
in Reims. You'll come along.

388
00:44:11,937 --> 00:44:16,139
We'll have two whole days
on our own.

389
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:18,016
That'll be wonderful.

390
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,226
Paris is no good for us.

391
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:23,271
Yes, you're right.

392
00:44:26,493 --> 00:44:27,734
Think of me.

393
00:44:35,126 --> 00:44:36,868
Where are you going now?

394
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,328
Home.

395
00:44:38,672 --> 00:44:40,997
I'll tell my wife I just got back.

396
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:46,158
I don't want you to go there.

397
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:18,899
What's the matter?

398
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:20,443
Just looking at...

399
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:22,246
your blue jeans.

400
00:45:23,884 --> 00:45:24,957
You disapprove?

401
00:45:25,802 --> 00:45:30,129
Well, I prefer you in dresses.
Did you bring any?

402
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,506
Of course.

403
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:33,925
Great.

404
00:45:34,853 --> 00:45:35,875
We need gas.

405
00:45:36,521 --> 00:45:37,512
Here?

406
00:45:53,788 --> 00:45:55,571
Fill it up, please.

407
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:08,019
50 francs.

408
00:47:56,912 --> 00:48:00,853
Look at your picture!

409
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,953
Are you giving a lecture in Reims?

410
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,041
No, I'm to present a film Allegret
made before Andre' Gide's death.

411
00:48:12,928 --> 00:48:17,297
I accepted only so that we can have
two days together.

412
00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:24,012
Look up the hotels in Reims.

413
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:34,981
The Grand Hotel's the best.

414
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:37,859
The sponsors will be at that one.

415
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:39,642
What's next?

416
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,531
Next, The Lion d'Or.

417
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:48,286
That might be risky too.

418
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:52,665
The Michelet just has rooms.

419
00:48:52,884 --> 00:48:55,877
We can eat out. Where is it?

420
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,505
It's place Michelet in Reims.

421
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:01,174
A room for two.

422
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:05,887
Did you make a reservation?
Number 12 is a double.

423
00:49:06,106 --> 00:49:07,889
Does it have a bathroom?
We'll take it.

424
00:49:08,108 --> 00:49:09,932
Any luggage?
I show you the way.

425
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:24,864
Excuse me, Madame.
I'll go first.

426
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,039
It's very quiet here.

427
00:49:33,258 --> 00:49:34,999
Thank you. That's for you.

428
00:49:36,636 --> 00:49:40,213
A nice little room.
Michelet's a good name.

429
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:43,216
I'd better unpack and bathe.

430
00:49:43,768 --> 00:49:45,927
There goes my last pair!

431
00:49:46,146 --> 00:49:48,179
I'd better run over

432
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:52,256
and let them know I'm here.

433
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:54,394
I won't be long.

434
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:58,471
I need stockings
and a ticket for tonight.

435
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:27,218
Don't forget my stockings!

436
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:31,264
- Hello, sir. Any luggage?
- No luggage.

437
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:39,939
- Your suite is all ready.
- No need, I can't stay.

438
00:50:40,158 --> 00:50:41,649
We'll take care of your luggage.

439
00:50:41,868 --> 00:50:43,901
- Do you want to rest?
- I'm not staying.

440
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:47,113
- How are you, old man?
- Fine and you?

441
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:49,814
Want to freshen up, first?

442
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:51,534
I'm alright.

443
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:55,872
When I invited you,
I was sure you'd refuse.

444
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:59,208
But they know we're friends,
so I had to try.

445
00:50:59,427 --> 00:51:00,793
Is your wife here?

446
00:51:01,012 --> 00:51:02,118
She's in Paris.

447
00:51:02,347 --> 00:51:03,452
Give her my best.

448
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:06,299
Let me introduce you.

449
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:09,135
Father Cote', our welfare chairman.

450
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:10,543
Pleased to meet you.

451
00:51:10,772 --> 00:51:13,681
Mr. Bertrand, our theatre manager.

452
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,351
Mme Laloix's in charge of...

453
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,227
Cultural exchanges.

454
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:19,937
... tonight's afair.

455
00:51:20,156 --> 00:51:22,482
Our cultural director

456
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:25,026
and his wife.

457
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:34,744
Why the dinner?

458
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:37,038
Didn't you know?

459
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:40,333
Out here we squeeze
a celebrity dry, like a lemon.

460
00:51:40,552 --> 00:51:42,710
I must get my car fixed.

461
00:51:42,929 --> 00:51:44,587
- Will you be long?
- Five minutes!

462
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:47,715
Okay, I'll keep them busy
with the canape's.

463
00:51:49,144 --> 00:51:50,301
Hurry back!

464
00:51:56,776 --> 00:51:59,519
Don't forget my stockings...

465
00:51:59,738 --> 00:52:00,979
Zibeline...

466
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:26,337
Neamat stocKings

467
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:45,023
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, we're closing.

468
00:52:45,242 --> 00:52:47,400
I'd like to buy some stockings.

469
00:52:57,212 --> 00:52:59,693
I bought you two pairs.

470
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:03,864
There are complications...
A dinner for me.

471
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:07,785
Then I'll eat next door,
but stay awhile.

472
00:53:08,014 --> 00:53:11,507
Impossible,
they're all waiting for me.

473
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:13,051
Alright, never mind.

474
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,719
You understand, don't you?

475
00:53:15,438 --> 00:53:16,627
See you later.

476
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:20,475
My ticket!

477
00:53:20,694 --> 00:53:23,144
Just buy one at the theatre.

478
00:53:23,363 --> 00:53:24,354
Which one?

479
00:53:24,573 --> 00:53:27,315
- The Capitol, I think.
- But where is it?

480
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:30,203
Ask the hotel people.

481
00:53:31,663 --> 00:53:33,237
I wonder why I'm here.

482
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,341
- You brought it back?
- They're too busy.

483
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,302
I swear that if it were me...
Come on.

484
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,516
You're at the head of the table,
a lady on each side.

485
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,105
Are you married?

486
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:08,398
I am.

487
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:10,483
Why isn't your wife with you?

488
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:12,402
My wife's home.

489
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:15,446
Oysters or potage,
take your choice.

490
00:54:18,418 --> 00:54:19,826
Do you know Reims?

491
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:20,868
Any children?

492
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:22,745
A real interview!

493
00:54:23,757 --> 00:54:26,791
I'll answer you one by one.

494
00:54:27,636 --> 00:54:28,960
I have a child.

495
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:32,463
I've never been here.

496
00:54:32,682 --> 00:54:35,550
And you're leaving tonight?

497
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:37,885
What about the smile of Reims?

498
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:40,179
Only Andre' Gide could get me

499
00:54:40,398 --> 00:54:41,889
back to the movies.

500
00:54:42,108 --> 00:54:42,890
Last time

501
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:45,268
was to see Charlie Chaplin.

502
00:54:46,071 --> 00:54:48,396
To fix a clock, he opened it

503
00:54:48,615 --> 00:54:50,023
with a can-opener.

504
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,066
I first saw the sea

505
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:54,110
at Paramount.

506
00:54:54,496 --> 00:54:57,697
Last month, we had Daninos.
You know him?

507
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,117
Not personally. How was it?

508
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:03,328
It was awful!

509
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,706
Everyone was late, it rained

510
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:09,250
and my dress was a disaster.

511
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,502
- Was it the colour?
- No.

512
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:16,132
It made me look terribly fat.
The afair was a real disaster!

513
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,802
Don't worry if our public
seems cold,

514
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:21,387
we never applaud.

515
00:55:23,024 --> 00:55:24,641
Did you know Gide?

516
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:28,353
- He sells books.
- I also happen to admire Gide.

517
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:30,730
I met him twice,

518
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:34,849
the second time,
shortly before his death.

519
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:36,444
Tell us about it.

520
00:55:37,122 --> 00:55:42,075
I'd rather save it for my speech
so as not to repeat myself.

521
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:43,858
As you like.

522
00:55:46,965 --> 00:55:49,447
A young lady to see you, sir.

523
00:55:53,763 --> 00:55:54,671
Are you sure?

524
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:11,187
I'm sorry to bother you, but since
I can't stay for your talk,

525
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:14,857
would you autograph this book
for me?

526
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:16,651
Of course.

527
00:56:18,538 --> 00:56:21,531
My name's Christiane Duchant.

528
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,283
With a ''t'', that's right.

529
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:28,246
Thank you very much.

530
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,999
He doesn't let anyone walk over him.

531
00:56:31,218 --> 00:56:35,586
Next year, it'll take us 72 minutes
to go to Paris by train.

532
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:39,080
Excuse me.

533
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:53,813
I must check the box-ofice.

534
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:13,207
Thank you for coming, Mr. Lachenay.

535
00:57:13,426 --> 00:57:17,670
Thanks to you, we're sold out.
A rare event in this movie crisis!

536
00:57:18,557 --> 00:57:22,675
Forgive me if I'm blunt,
but I'm a businessman.

537
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,678
Tonight's big turnout

538
00:57:25,897 --> 00:57:27,889
isn't for Gide, it's for you!

539
00:57:28,108 --> 00:57:29,891
They've seen you on TV.

540
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,851
Time to go.

541
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,853
This way.

542
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,733
Take this.

543
00:57:42,664 --> 00:57:45,365
I must leave you now
to check the hall.

544
00:57:45,584 --> 00:57:48,368
See you later, at the reception.

545
00:57:48,587 --> 00:57:51,329
I'm sorry I can't stay for it.

546
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:54,957
I must be back in Paris tonight.

547
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:57,919
What a pity.
Thanks again for coming.

548
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:00,588
And good luck!

549
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,722
Put your coat down.

550
00:58:13,778 --> 00:58:16,177
I make a quick announcement.

551
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:18,690
We turn the lights on.

552
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:20,733
Then you walk on.

553
00:58:22,704 --> 00:58:25,989
We shake hands.
Then you're on your own!

554
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:27,448
Alright.

555
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:34,080
Shall I go?

556
00:58:37,886 --> 00:58:40,586
The friendship of a great man

557
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:43,840
is a godsend. There's no need

558
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:46,624
to introduce Pierre Lachenay.

559
00:58:46,853 --> 00:58:51,472
But I'd like to thank him
for coming here tonight.

560
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:06,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've learned

561
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:10,147
that men's unhappiness arises
from the inability

562
00:59:10,377 --> 00:59:13,536
to stay quietly in their own room.

563
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,413
Had I recalled this

564
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,582
a few hours ago,

565
00:59:17,884 --> 00:59:20,877
I wouldn't be here now.
Frankly,

566
00:59:21,096 --> 00:59:22,670
I'm rather nervous.

567
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:25,840
I'm not a cinema expert,

568
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:30,094
... but I had the great pleasure
to meet Andre' Gide twice.

569
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,347
One ticket please.

570
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:34,474
No more seats.

571
00:59:34,818 --> 00:59:38,394
- The balcony?
- We're all sold out.

572
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:41,773
Can I stand inside if I pay?

573
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:43,650
That's impossible, Mademoiselle.

574
00:59:44,035 --> 00:59:47,403
- Really?
- Absolutely. I'm sorry.

575
00:59:48,915 --> 00:59:51,908
This lady insists on going in.

576
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:56,663
All seats were sold out in advance.

577
00:59:56,882 --> 00:59:58,623
You can close up now.

578
00:59:59,384 --> 01:00:02,168
Everybody has read or held

579
01:00:02,387 --> 01:00:05,380
a book from the famous
''Ple'iade'' collection

580
01:00:05,724 --> 01:00:09,133
which publishes the entire work
of an author in one tome.

581
01:00:09,769 --> 01:00:13,888
Gide got the idea
for this collection

582
01:00:14,107 --> 01:00:16,589
by reading the Bible.

583
01:00:16,818 --> 01:00:19,300
He said:
''My dear Lachenay,

584
01:00:19,988 --> 01:00:23,846
''our talk today will help you
read my books.

585
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:27,767
''Am I the man required?''
I reassured Andre' Gide.

586
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:34,158
But time flies...
In conclusion,

587
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:39,580
I should like to read
a few of Gide's final words:

588
01:00:40,217 --> 01:00:42,333
''I ofer no doctrine,

589
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:44,919
''I refuse to give advice

590
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:48,214
''and I shy away from discussions.

591
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:52,135
''But I know that many today
are searching

592
01:00:52,354 --> 01:00:54,429
''for someone to believe in.

593
01:00:55,232 --> 01:00:57,265
''To them, I say,

594
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,268
''trust those who seek the truth,

595
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:05,106
''beware of those who've fount it,
question everything,

596
01:01:05,325 --> 01:01:07,775
''but believe in yourself.''

597
01:01:12,499 --> 01:01:15,064
And now, Marc Allegret's film.

598
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:19,829
Great speech!

599
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:22,498
- You think so?
- Really. It was perfect.

600
01:01:22,717 --> 01:01:26,044
Listen, in plaYing this,

601
01:01:26,471 --> 01:01:31,007
Your fist concern
is to generate emotion...

602
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:33,009
Our friend Gide is great.

603
01:01:33,228 --> 01:01:36,137
- He looks like a wrestler.
- True.

604
01:01:36,481 --> 01:01:39,807
... not merelY Your own,
but for others as well.

605
01:01:40,026 --> 01:01:41,601
Now, do it again,

606
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,678
no, just from this part on.

607
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:53,321
Do you want to see the rest?

608
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,198
Not really.

609
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:58,159
Let's have a drink.

610
01:02:02,924 --> 01:02:05,667
Can You imagine me a provincial...

611
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:13,675
buried out here?
But I've kept my studio in Paris.

612
01:02:21,776 --> 01:02:24,143
Did you forget something?

613
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:34,351
Let's go.

614
01:02:46,259 --> 01:02:49,252
You talked but I'm thirsty.

615
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:51,952
Bertrand should have a bar
in his theatre...

616
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:54,549
- Let me pass.
- Don't run away like this.

617
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:57,218
... but he won't listen to me.

618
01:02:57,896 --> 01:03:01,973
After nine, it's tough
to get a drink around here.

619
01:03:02,776 --> 01:03:06,269
There was a place,
but it's closed now.

620
01:03:06,738 --> 01:03:09,814
The owner had a fight
with the cops.

621
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:11,555
Do you want one?

622
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,653
Nothing doing out here,

623
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:19,073
but inside those walls, who knows?

624
01:03:20,126 --> 01:03:24,579
You remember that girI,

625
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:26,497
the recluse of Poitiers?

626
01:03:27,092 --> 01:03:30,126
I think there's a place nearby.

627
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:33,630
I've been there once, a month ago.
Shall we go in?

628
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:35,673
Friends first.

629
01:03:42,482 --> 01:03:45,475
What do you want?
I'll have a beer.

630
01:03:48,196 --> 01:03:49,385
Two draft beers.

631
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:51,230
It'll limit the damage.

632
01:03:53,285 --> 01:03:54,651
The film runs over an hour.

633
01:04:04,421 --> 01:04:06,162
Cigarette?

634
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:44,575
What's wrong?

635
01:04:46,588 --> 01:04:47,693
Too hot in here.

636
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:53,584
You seem upset.

637
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:58,047
Cle'ment, let's get out of here.

638
01:04:59,517 --> 01:05:01,801
You do look awful.

639
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,179
Can I finish your beer?

640
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:18,078
Let's go back to the hotel.

641
01:05:20,747 --> 01:05:23,197
A little nap will do you good.

642
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:27,910
You'll be peaceful in your room.
Those jerks would demoralize anyone.

643
01:05:28,213 --> 01:05:32,415
Getting you here
is like throwing pearIs to swine!

644
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:35,668
Your speech was really great
and I mean it.

645
01:05:36,471 --> 01:05:39,339
In fact, all your work

646
01:05:39,724 --> 01:05:41,049
is first-rate.

647
01:05:41,268 --> 01:05:45,803
All they do here is eat!
Lachenay in Reims? Presto, a dinner!

648
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:49,307
They eat their heads of, for free!

649
01:05:49,526 --> 01:05:52,007
That's why they go for culture.

650
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:54,896
Damn that shoelace.

651
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:58,775
I'll try and fix it.
It's the second time tonight.

652
01:05:59,744 --> 01:06:02,362
To every man, his own woes.

653
01:06:02,581 --> 01:06:04,656
Mine's shoelaces.

654
01:06:04,874 --> 01:06:08,993
I hate them so,
I always wear moccasins.

655
01:06:09,212 --> 01:06:12,372
But I put my best shoes on,
in your honour

656
01:06:12,591 --> 01:06:17,825
and they're killing me!
You might say I'm caught in a pinch!

657
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:22,632
Remember Lachere's wedding? At noon,
the bride hadn't even turned up.

658
01:06:29,357 --> 01:06:30,723
What are you doing here?

659
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:33,101
That's a good question.

660
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,563
Forgive me, I've got to shake
that pest. I won't be long.

661
01:06:55,508 --> 01:06:57,417
I couldn't figure out
where you'd gone.

662
01:06:57,636 --> 01:07:01,327
You vanished into thin air,
like a flying saucer.

663
01:07:01,556 --> 01:07:03,673
To quote the defeated general:

664
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:08,052
''I searched high and low
and all around me,

665
01:07:08,271 --> 01:07:12,807
''at a loss to know
what happened to my army.''

666
01:07:13,026 --> 01:07:14,600
God, you look awful!

667
01:07:15,153 --> 01:07:19,272
This town shuts down at 9 p.m.
In Spain and Italy,

668
01:07:19,491 --> 01:07:22,442
people stay out half the night.

669
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:26,112
In France, we're so stingy
we go to bed early

670
01:07:26,331 --> 01:07:28,896
just to save electricity.

671
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:30,950
You look really tired.

672
01:07:31,378 --> 01:07:33,828
You'd better have a nap
at the hotel.

673
01:07:34,047 --> 01:07:36,914
I'll pick you up for the reception.

674
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,083
I'm not staying for it.

675
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:43,463
Do they know?

676
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:45,621
They'll be sore as hell.

677
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:49,177
Not at all. I told them about it.

678
01:07:49,396 --> 01:07:50,803
I didn't know that.

679
01:07:51,022 --> 01:07:53,640
In that case,
I don't have to go either.

680
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:56,893
- Are you driving to Paris?
- Right now.

681
01:07:57,112 --> 01:07:59,187
Great! Take me along.

682
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:01,689
- To Paris?
- Yes, I'll go with you.

683
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:02,815
Alright.

684
01:08:03,034 --> 01:08:05,360
Is your car here?

685
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:09,645
I'll get my bag, wait here.
And bye-bye everyone!

686
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:14,744
Only be a minute!

687
01:08:57,297 --> 01:09:01,958
Get dressed. Let's get out of here.
This town is getting on my nerves.

688
01:09:03,803 --> 01:09:05,753
We're leaving!

689
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:12,093
Nicole, did you hear me?

690
01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:14,554
Go if you want to. I'll stay.

691
01:09:15,148 --> 01:09:16,723
What do you mean?

692
01:09:18,068 --> 01:09:19,809
I mean I'm fed up.

693
01:09:20,487 --> 01:09:22,687
Don't you want to go?

694
01:09:22,906 --> 01:09:24,439
Go yourself!

695
01:09:26,243 --> 01:09:29,610
I'll take a train to Paris
in the morning.

696
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:32,196
Just leave me alone.

697
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:36,284
Go away!

698
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:40,038
I didn't ask to come.
It was entirely your idea

699
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:44,511
and then, you're ashamed of me.

700
01:09:44,803 --> 01:09:47,337
It was all so humiliating.

701
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:53,176
That creep trying to pick me up
in the street.

702
01:09:55,397 --> 01:09:57,962
I felt humiliated too.

703
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,184
But what could I do?
I was trapped.

704
01:10:01,987 --> 01:10:04,937
It's been a real nightmare.

705
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:08,274
Please forgive me, my darling.

706
01:10:10,912 --> 01:10:12,945
You want us to stay here tonight?

707
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,243
No, let's leave right away.

708
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,455
I'll run down to pay the bill.

709
01:10:33,894 --> 01:10:35,134
The bill, please.

710
01:10:35,353 --> 01:10:40,640
Right now? They're all asleep.
I can't do bills. Wait till morning.

711
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:44,102
Sorry, but I must leave now.

712
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:46,646
I'll help you with the bill.

713
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:49,065
We'll work it out.

714
01:10:49,576 --> 01:10:51,192
How much for the room?

715
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:52,276
40 francs.

716
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:56,823
Add a few extras...
that's about 80 Francs.

717
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:58,366
Here's 120!

718
01:10:58,585 --> 01:11:00,702
Anyway, you've got my address.

719
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:03,079
Let me carry your bags.

720
01:11:03,298 --> 01:11:05,206
Never mind. We'll manage.

721
01:11:13,433 --> 01:11:17,635
Damn it, we have to pass
the Grand Hotel.

722
01:11:18,396 --> 01:11:20,138
See that guy?

723
01:11:20,357 --> 01:11:22,223
With the tan coat?

724
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:24,058
God!

725
01:11:27,614 --> 01:11:29,105
He says: ''I'll go too!''

726
01:11:29,324 --> 01:11:30,940
What did you do?

727
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:35,695
I was stunned, but when he went
inside, I ran of like a thief.

728
01:11:38,124 --> 01:11:39,699
Crazy, isn't it?

729
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:46,039
Forgive me.

730
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:48,541
Sacha Guitry said:

731
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,501
''When they yawn,

732
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,837
''it's time to say bye-bye.''

733
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:58,217
- Is the Coliniere good?
- According to the guide, yes.

734
01:11:58,436 --> 01:12:00,887
They say it's an ice inn
with separate cabins.

735
01:12:01,356 --> 01:12:03,890
That's right, come closer darling.

736
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:05,350
Go to sleep.

737
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:38,925
Forgive me.

738
01:12:42,022 --> 01:12:43,930
Here's the bathroom.

739
01:12:45,984 --> 01:12:47,684
Do you need anything?

740
01:12:47,903 --> 01:12:49,091
No, thank you.

741
01:13:17,224 --> 01:13:18,496
You asleep?

742
01:13:23,647 --> 01:13:25,054
You're tired.

743
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:04,737
When my brother bet

744
01:15:04,956 --> 01:15:07,699
he'd shave his head
with his electric razor,

745
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:11,859
Papa told him not to come back
till his hair grew in.

746
01:15:12,172 --> 01:15:13,538
So he left home.

747
01:15:13,757 --> 01:15:15,665
And why did you leave?

748
01:15:15,884 --> 01:15:17,709
To take the airline job.

749
01:15:18,929 --> 01:15:22,380
- How'd you get it?
- By passing a test.

750
01:15:22,599 --> 01:15:25,675
I know a little Spanish,
I studied English in London.

751
01:15:25,894 --> 01:15:27,166
Well, nearby. For a year.

752
01:15:27,395 --> 01:15:30,388
- Any friends there?
- Not at first.

753
01:15:30,607 --> 01:15:32,765
I was homesick, but my parents

754
01:15:32,984 --> 01:15:34,434
made me stay.

755
01:15:35,737 --> 01:15:38,771
- Later, I made friends.
- Why couldn't you go home?

756
01:15:39,157 --> 01:15:43,359
In Bordeaux,
I'd had a crush on a boy

757
01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:45,570
and my parents
wanted me to forget him.

758
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:47,947
Was he your first?

759
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:51,492
No, the first was in London.

760
01:15:52,087 --> 01:15:53,077
An Englishman?

761
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:54,662
No, a Frenchman.

762
01:15:55,423 --> 01:15:57,290
Did you love him?

763
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,325
No, it was silly,
it didn't last.

764
01:16:02,389 --> 01:16:03,212
And after him?

765
01:16:05,267 --> 01:16:08,301
Two or three.
They didn't mean anything.

766
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,553
I was too young, I guess.

767
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:15,099
But the first time
it mattered physically

768
01:16:15,318 --> 01:16:17,101
was last year.

769
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:18,936
I didn't want him

770
01:16:19,155 --> 01:16:21,522
but he was always around.

771
01:16:22,826 --> 01:16:24,901
Finally, he almost raped me.

772
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,821
It's strange. He thrilled me,

773
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:32,492
yet, I didn't love him.

774
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,454
It didn't last very long.

775
01:16:36,673 --> 01:16:40,583
I felt squeamish,
as if I'd been soiled.

776
01:16:41,761 --> 01:16:44,879
When I got home, I'd take a bath.
It was ridiculous.

777
01:16:45,098 --> 01:16:47,882
I even hated

778
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:49,592
the clothes he'd touched.

779
01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:52,251
What did he work at?

780
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,310
Gosh, this is heavy!

781
01:17:00,113 --> 01:17:01,729
Is he in aviation?

782
01:17:01,948 --> 01:17:04,273
Yes, a pilot. You've met Frank.

783
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:07,026
I knew it!

784
01:17:07,245 --> 01:17:11,155
I sensed it before our dinner
in Lisbon.

785
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:14,325
And when we met?

786
01:17:14,544 --> 01:17:15,910
There was no one.

787
01:17:16,129 --> 01:17:16,786
And Frank?

788
01:17:17,005 --> 01:17:20,206
I broke of with Frank months ago.

789
01:17:20,508 --> 01:17:22,000
- Others?
- No one at all.

790
01:17:23,261 --> 01:17:27,088
I like to make love,
yet I can go without for months.

791
01:17:28,391 --> 01:17:30,049
Do you mind me talking about it?

792
01:17:30,268 --> 01:17:31,373
Are you sure?

793
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:35,346
I don't really know Frank,
but I hate his type.

794
01:17:35,565 --> 01:17:37,056
What do you mean?

795
01:17:37,275 --> 01:17:39,434
He's too sure of himself.

796
01:17:39,653 --> 01:17:41,394
Not really,

797
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:45,940
but I don't care enough to defend
him. Anyway, why talk about Frank?

798
01:17:50,163 --> 01:17:51,435
Wait!

799
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:36,115
In profile.

800
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:37,523
Look at me.

801
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,912
One more.

802
01:18:42,632 --> 01:18:44,499
I don't like your legs like that.

803
01:18:44,885 --> 01:18:45,875
Don't cross them.

804
01:18:46,094 --> 01:18:47,794
Let me show you.

805
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:53,956
Like this.

806
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:57,720
There.

807
01:19:13,997 --> 01:19:16,239
My legs hurt!

808
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:18,491
One more with the automatic shutter.

809
01:19:22,297 --> 01:19:24,455
Now, you and me together.

810
01:19:34,017 --> 01:19:36,686
See, I'm lucky at games.

811
01:19:44,194 --> 01:19:47,437
Have you always been
so interested in women?

812
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:52,431
Funny, it's only since I know you.

813
01:19:52,994 --> 01:19:55,528
I must be stimulating.

814
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:00,491
Where do you go in summer?

815
01:20:00,835 --> 01:20:02,243
My kids love Brittany.

816
01:20:14,099 --> 01:20:17,873
The cleaner can get it out.

817
01:20:21,398 --> 01:20:22,503
Look, Pierre.

818
01:20:24,317 --> 01:20:26,100
See that woman?

819
01:20:27,153 --> 01:20:29,604
I used to be a blonde, real cute!

820
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,564
You don't believe me?

821
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:33,858
Now, look there.

822
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:39,656
What do you see?

823
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:45,568
The same blouse.

824
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:47,121
Right.

825
01:20:47,966 --> 01:20:48,915
Leopard skin.

826
01:20:51,887 --> 01:20:56,130
Women who wear them
like making love.

827
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:09,227
There's something wrong.
What is it?

828
01:21:09,487 --> 01:21:11,604
Nothing.

829
01:21:12,407 --> 01:21:16,317
I know you.
I can tell you're worried.

830
01:21:16,786 --> 01:21:17,975
Something I did?

831
01:21:19,581 --> 01:21:21,239
Something I said?

832
01:21:23,043 --> 01:21:24,148
It's awkward...

833
01:21:30,717 --> 01:21:34,919
I know, you've got to call
your wife.

834
01:21:36,223 --> 01:21:37,046
That's it.

835
01:21:38,225 --> 01:21:40,300
Couldn't you just say so?

836
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,428
I'll be outside.

837
01:21:44,522 --> 01:21:45,930
Tell me when you're finished.

838
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:52,770
Connect me with Passy 42-70.

839
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:06,242
You're alright, Franca?

840
01:22:06,461 --> 01:22:07,650
Yes, and You?

841
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:09,370
I'm fine,

842
01:22:09,714 --> 01:22:11,122
but something came up.

843
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:14,959
They wanted a repeat performance

844
01:22:15,178 --> 01:22:18,921
so I had to stay over.
I'll be home tonight.

845
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:22,050
You calling from Reims?

846
01:22:22,602 --> 01:22:23,676
Yes, Reims.

847
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:26,346
ReallY?
I called Reims two nights ago

848
01:22:26,565 --> 01:22:29,390
and was told You"d just left
for paris.

849
01:22:57,095 --> 01:22:59,045
I'll call you tomorrow.

850
01:23:02,058 --> 01:23:03,424
Do you love me?

851
01:23:05,186 --> 01:23:06,010
Yes.

852
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:08,429
Why won't you say it?

853
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:14,769
Because you don't like
to spell it out, is that it?

854
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,272
That's it exactly.

855
01:23:24,664 --> 01:23:26,406
Don't forget me.

856
01:24:41,575 --> 01:24:43,024
I know, you were

857
01:24:43,243 --> 01:24:44,609
with a girI.

858
01:24:46,788 --> 01:24:47,977
Answer me.

859
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:54,160
Kanayan told me his article
wouldn't be ready

860
01:24:54,379 --> 01:24:55,620
in time.

861
01:24:55,839 --> 01:24:57,872
So I called the hotel in Reims,

862
01:24:58,884 --> 01:25:00,625
you'd left the night before.

863
01:25:01,761 --> 01:25:04,587
You were driving, I became frantic.

864
01:25:04,806 --> 01:25:06,078
A lot you care!

865
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,591
How could you treat me that way?

866
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,592
Listen, Franca.

867
01:25:09,811 --> 01:25:12,845
Was that asking too much,
a few days with you?

868
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:16,683
We could have gone of right
after the lecture.

869
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:19,352
I've waited for five years.

870
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:21,020
You exaggerate!

871
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:22,897
No, I've counted them.

872
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:26,390
I was upset. I needed to be alone.

873
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,018
If you'd only said that to me.

874
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:31,990
You'd never understand it!

875
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,282
Not so loud.

876
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,077
Sabine never wakes up.

877
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:38,788
Maybe not, but the nurse is here.

878
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:42,375
After all, I might want

879
01:25:42,594 --> 01:25:43,543
to go out.

880
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:45,420
I need some fun too!

881
01:25:47,766 --> 01:25:49,966
Franca, I'm tired.

882
01:25:50,185 --> 01:25:53,344
So am I,
but it's high time we talked.

883
01:25:55,941 --> 01:25:57,724
Say something!

884
01:25:58,526 --> 01:26:00,351
If I'm wrong, say so.

885
01:26:00,612 --> 01:26:03,229
I'm not up to talking just now.

886
01:26:03,448 --> 01:26:05,231
If there was woman...
tell me.

887
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:08,067
It would hurt far less if I knew.

888
01:26:08,286 --> 01:26:12,572
- I was alone!
- I don't believe you.

889
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:13,896
I don't care!

890
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,147
Thanks a lot!

891
01:26:15,502 --> 01:26:18,494
You expect me to be kind?
In what way?

892
01:26:18,797 --> 01:26:20,069
Be considerate.

893
01:26:20,298 --> 01:26:22,457
What for, you're not sick.

894
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:24,334
Yes, thanks to you, I am sick!

895
01:26:25,053 --> 01:26:26,586
I haven't slept in two nights.

896
01:26:33,103 --> 01:26:35,772
Pierre, maybe we should separate.

897
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:39,307
I'm serious.

898
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:41,643
Alright, I'll go.

899
01:26:50,161 --> 01:26:51,611
I didn't mean all that.

900
01:26:52,455 --> 01:26:54,489
I'm upset. I was nasty.

901
01:26:55,292 --> 01:26:59,150
Look, I propose
we try an experiment.

902
01:26:59,588 --> 01:27:03,279
No fighting for a month.
After that we decide.

903
01:27:04,009 --> 01:27:06,084
We've experimented for years.

904
01:27:06,511 --> 01:27:08,670
I won't forgive this.

905
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:00,513
Hello, Dominique.

906
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,391
Yes, I slept here.

907
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:07,228
- How did you get your flat?
- The Chaude agency.

908
01:28:07,447 --> 01:28:10,815
Better call them,
I've got to find a flat.

909
01:28:11,534 --> 01:28:13,609
I'm going out for cofee.

910
01:28:16,039 --> 01:28:17,488
Madame Lachenay.

911
01:28:19,209 --> 01:28:20,742
I'll take it in there.

912
01:28:28,218 --> 01:28:29,876
Did You sleep well?

913
01:28:30,345 --> 01:28:32,743
Well, I was up all night.

914
01:28:32,973 --> 01:28:36,633
This is just to thanK You
for walKing out on me.

915
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:38,926
I"d forgive anything but that.

916
01:28:39,145 --> 01:28:41,929
Odile"s cousin will act
as mY lawYer.

917
01:28:42,148 --> 01:28:44,474
- As what?
- MY divorce lawYer!

918
01:28:44,693 --> 01:28:48,144
I suggest You get someone too.
WhY waste time?

919
01:28:48,363 --> 01:28:50,021
I won"t be alone long.

920
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:54,067
Your bags are all pacKed.
picK them up anY time.

921
01:29:01,793 --> 01:29:06,204
I called your ofice,
but you'd gone.

922
01:29:06,423 --> 01:29:09,499
You can't stay.
My father's in town.

923
01:29:09,718 --> 01:29:13,409
He's on his way here.
And I'll be away till Friday.

924
01:29:13,763 --> 01:29:17,757
Let's have dinner Friday.
I've got important news.

925
01:29:18,184 --> 01:29:20,468
Important? Tell me now.

926
01:29:20,687 --> 01:29:23,471
No, you're rushed
and this takes time.

927
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:25,556
Come on,

928
01:29:25,775 --> 01:29:29,769
you tell me you've got big news
and now you won't talk. Tell me.

929
01:29:29,988 --> 01:29:31,938
Nothing doing!

930
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:35,900
Just tell me
if it's something pleasant.

931
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:40,655
I'm not sure.
But it is serious and important.

932
01:29:40,874 --> 01:29:42,490
What is it?

933
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:45,962
I meant to explain it properly.
It's just this...

934
01:29:46,922 --> 01:29:51,457
My wife and I are separating
by mutual agreement.

935
01:29:54,054 --> 01:29:55,211
Listen,

936
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:58,381
there's my dad, you'd better run.
See you Friday.

937
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,676
We won't meet at the airport,
but here.

938
01:30:01,895 --> 01:30:03,052
Alright.

939
01:30:16,576 --> 01:30:17,734
Excuse me, sir.

940
01:30:26,044 --> 01:30:28,286
- Hello, daddy!
- Hello, darling.

941
01:30:28,505 --> 01:30:29,954
I'm almost ready.

942
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:42,842
See, I walk like a lady.

943
01:30:59,828 --> 01:31:02,612
My lawyer's waiting
to hear from yours.

944
01:31:02,831 --> 01:31:04,489
It's not that urgent.

945
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:08,399
Yes, it is.
I don't like ambiguous situations.

946
01:31:08,628 --> 01:31:10,453
We can't talk here.

947
01:31:10,672 --> 01:31:13,206
Then, let's go to the study.

948
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:27,501
Sit down.

949
01:31:27,772 --> 01:31:29,389
I'd rather stand.

950
01:31:30,358 --> 01:31:32,225
I'm taking this one.

951
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:36,729
That one too.

952
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:41,442
Your bags are ready,
they're in the hall.

953
01:31:42,287 --> 01:31:45,071
I didn't know where to send them.

954
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:47,907
Where do you live?

955
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:50,118
I sleep in the ofice.

956
01:31:50,879 --> 01:31:52,996
I plan to take a flat.

957
01:31:53,215 --> 01:31:54,080
You fool!

958
01:31:54,299 --> 01:31:56,499
- Listen Franca!
- I won't listen.

959
01:31:56,927 --> 01:32:00,461
What got into you?
Weren't you happy here?

960
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:05,258
- What's got into you?
- Not in front of the girI.

961
01:32:05,477 --> 01:32:07,760
Now he thinks about her.

962
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:10,013
Go play with Mademoiselle.

963
01:32:10,357 --> 01:32:13,026
Sabine, go and see Mademoiselle.

964
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,268
Come here, Sabine!

965
01:32:17,447 --> 01:32:19,147
Kanayan called.

966
01:32:19,449 --> 01:32:23,109
I gave him the ofice number.
You were out,

967
01:32:23,912 --> 01:32:25,820
so he rang here.

968
01:32:26,414 --> 01:32:29,699
I told him
you weren't living here anymore.

969
01:32:30,544 --> 01:32:32,702
What else could I tell him?

970
01:32:33,046 --> 01:32:35,955
The truth, we decided to separate.

971
01:32:36,258 --> 01:32:38,416
We decided to separate!

972
01:32:38,969 --> 01:32:41,002
You'd like me to say that.

973
01:32:41,263 --> 01:32:42,754
Don't count on it.

974
01:32:43,056 --> 01:32:45,089
I'll say that you left me.

975
01:32:45,308 --> 01:32:47,925
Isn't it true, you were fed up?

976
01:32:48,144 --> 01:32:49,010
Calm down, Franca.

977
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:52,055
You're a louse!

978
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:56,100
Forgive me, Pierre.

979
01:32:56,778 --> 01:33:00,605
I didn't mean to do that,
but I'm so tired.

980
01:33:01,783 --> 01:33:03,691
Come here, sit by me.

981
01:33:06,246 --> 01:33:08,488
I'm sorry for all I said.

982
01:33:09,457 --> 01:33:11,199
You must loathe me.

983
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:14,535
No Franca, I loathe myself.

984
01:33:15,547 --> 01:33:16,913
Kiss me.

985
01:33:49,456 --> 01:33:51,114
We'll play in your room.

986
01:33:53,585 --> 01:33:56,067
This will go to the cleaner.

987
01:34:25,367 --> 01:34:27,150
I'm taking her out.

988
01:34:27,369 --> 01:34:28,776
Bye, darling.

989
01:34:29,412 --> 01:34:30,820
Bye-bye, daddy.

990
01:34:32,582 --> 01:34:34,157
Come on, we're leaving.

991
01:34:43,385 --> 01:34:45,084
They probably forgot something.

992
01:34:49,349 --> 01:34:51,966
I'd better come back later.

993
01:34:52,602 --> 01:34:55,303
No, stay here.
Anyway, Pierre's leaving.

994
01:34:57,524 --> 01:34:59,057
I must be going.

995
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,309
Call me tonight. I'd like that.

996
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:03,436
Really?

997
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:08,399
You got some champagne from Reims.

998
01:35:09,202 --> 01:35:11,444
Just keep it in the cellar.

999
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,908
Here's the Foujita.

1000
01:35:17,335 --> 01:35:19,369
What for? I gave it to you.

1001
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:20,995
Take it back.

1002
01:35:21,214 --> 01:35:23,612
I don't want it, it's yours.
Keep it.

1003
01:35:32,058 --> 01:35:35,009
Want to come back for supper,
or to sleep,

1004
01:35:36,354 --> 01:35:37,929
or just for supper?

1005
01:35:38,148 --> 01:35:42,725
It won't work, you know
with all that's happened.

1006
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:59,534
I'm sorry Odile, I can't go
with you, I don't feel well.

1007
01:36:01,087 --> 01:36:02,745
What a fool I am!

1008
01:36:02,964 --> 01:36:05,123
I should have known better.

1009
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:07,542
What's Pierre done to you?

1010
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:09,419
What did he want?

1011
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:15,216
That's what he wanted!

1012
01:36:25,028 --> 01:36:28,563
Top luxury apartment blocK
ReadY for autumn 64

1013
01:36:28,782 --> 01:36:31,649
Franca, you've got to calm down.

1014
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:33,860
You need some sleep.

1015
01:36:35,163 --> 01:36:36,821
Let me have a sleeping pill?

1016
01:36:44,631 --> 01:36:46,706
You said you'd be right down.

1017
01:36:46,925 --> 01:36:49,490
I'd better stay.
Franca's very upset

1018
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:53,755
over Pierre. I'm afraid
she might do something foolish.

1019
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:20,709
In the plane today,

1020
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:22,659
In the plane today,

1021
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:24,702
we ran into a storm.

1022
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:27,163
One of the passengers,
an American,

1023
01:37:27,382 --> 01:37:31,240
was scared.
He drank so much whiskey,

1024
01:37:31,469 --> 01:37:35,880
he went berserk. He drove us all
crazy, it was real wild!

1025
01:37:36,099 --> 01:37:39,175
Don't talk so loud,
people are staring.

1026
01:37:40,061 --> 01:37:42,011
You're charming tonight.

1027
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,766
Did your dad enjoy Paris?

1028
01:37:51,781 --> 01:37:53,439
Did he have a good time?

1029
01:37:54,868 --> 01:37:56,109
I don't know.

1030
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,695
I'm tired. Please take me home.

1031
01:37:59,831 --> 01:38:03,324
Why? The program starts
in ten minutes.

1032
01:38:05,462 --> 01:38:06,786
Take me home.

1033
01:38:07,714 --> 01:38:09,747
You were so eager to come here.

1034
01:38:11,259 --> 01:38:14,502
Well, now I'm tired.
I leave tomorrow.

1035
01:38:16,681 --> 01:38:17,703
Mad at me?

1036
01:38:21,019 --> 01:38:21,843
You're sure?

1037
01:38:23,563 --> 01:38:25,346
Positive.

1038
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:35,064
I wasn't very good company, I know,

1039
01:38:35,283 --> 01:38:37,025
but you must understand,

1040
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:39,736
I've had a pretty rough week.

1041
01:38:39,996 --> 01:38:42,280
Franca... the separation...

1042
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:46,409
I thought you both wanted
this separation.

1043
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:48,953
Yes, of course,

1044
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:52,832
but it's not so easy
after 15 years.

1045
01:38:53,218 --> 01:38:54,709
You told her about me?

1046
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:59,297
No. I thought
the later, the better.

1047
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:01,007
I don't agree.

1048
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:06,220
If it was me, I'd prefer the truth
even if it's another girI.

1049
01:39:07,148 --> 01:39:08,640
You know the score.

1050
01:39:08,858 --> 01:39:10,725
I didn't see it that way.

1051
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:12,894
Speaking as a man...

1052
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:16,189
I tell you, it's a mistake.

1053
01:39:18,034 --> 01:39:20,109
You may be right. I'll tell her,

1054
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:22,945
but it won't be easy.

1055
01:39:24,374 --> 01:39:26,658
You see, it's been hard on me too,

1056
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:29,369
harder than I thought.

1057
01:39:29,921 --> 01:39:31,579
We're used to each other

1058
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:36,417
and there's Sabine.
I'll miss seeing her every day.

1059
01:39:37,804 --> 01:39:41,005
If that's how it is,
you sure goofed!

1060
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:46,010
You can give Sabine
some calves liver for lunch...

1061
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:49,055
I'll get the door!
And some mashed potatoes.

1062
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:53,726
The suit from the cleaner's.

1063
01:39:53,945 --> 01:39:55,269
Hold on.

1064
01:39:58,116 --> 01:40:01,651
We found this stub in the pocket.

1065
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:03,528
Thank you.

1066
01:40:11,004 --> 01:40:12,370
photo enlargement

1067
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:25,174
This is the living room.

1068
01:40:27,854 --> 01:40:30,722
There, my study and the library.

1069
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:35,549
That will be our room,

1070
01:40:36,696 --> 01:40:38,688
with Sabine's next to it
for when she visits us.

1071
01:40:38,907 --> 01:40:41,576
I'll get an extra room
for the nanny.

1072
01:40:45,121 --> 01:40:46,738
So you want to marry me?

1073
01:40:47,582 --> 01:40:51,075
If I say yes, you'll talk
to my father. Is that it?

1074
01:40:53,797 --> 01:40:55,246
Listen to me,

1075
01:40:56,633 --> 01:41:00,001
I've discovered
some facts of life lately.

1076
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:02,795
There's a misunderstanding.

1077
01:41:03,348 --> 01:41:07,800
When you looked me up in Paris,
I was pleased because

1078
01:41:08,019 --> 01:41:10,094
I thought you might misjudge me

1079
01:41:10,313 --> 01:41:12,388
after what happened in Lisbon.

1080
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:17,028
On the way here, I guessed...

1081
01:41:18,613 --> 01:41:22,304
but now that it's out,
I've got to speak up.

1082
01:41:24,077 --> 01:41:27,852
It's just as well
you bought it to a head...

1083
01:41:28,081 --> 01:41:29,864
It was all happening too quickly.

1084
01:41:31,042 --> 01:41:34,369
Because it just would have
dragged on

1085
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,986
to wind up the same way.

1086
01:41:37,924 --> 01:41:39,540
What's the point?

1087
01:41:40,844 --> 01:41:42,877
In the restaurant last night,

1088
01:41:43,096 --> 01:41:46,631
I irritated you, I could tell.

1089
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:48,633
You almost hated me.

1090
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:49,801
It's true.

1091
01:41:52,522 --> 01:41:55,974
To plan a wedding when you reach
that point, it makes no sense!

1092
01:41:58,528 --> 01:42:01,729
I know you're hurt.
I feel bad, too.

1093
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:09,112
If you'd like, we could

1094
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:11,072
meet from time to time.

1095
01:42:18,757 --> 01:42:20,540
I'm truly sorry.

1096
01:42:23,094 --> 01:42:24,366
Bye, Pierre.

1097
01:43:39,462 --> 01:43:41,454
- How much is it?
- 14 francs.

1098
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:42,640
Need some help?

1099
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:45,768
How about a little walk?

1100
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:49,480
Why hurry home?

1101
01:44:58,708 --> 01:45:02,368
We can go to a cafe',
or up to my place.

1102
01:45:02,712 --> 01:45:04,704
Who the hell are you?

1103
01:45:04,923 --> 01:45:06,748
What are you after?

1104
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:11,336
Do all women go for you?
You take them to the country?

1105
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:15,173
Irresistible, a Don Juan...

1106
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:18,009
God's gift to women?

1107
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:21,512
Ever take a good look at yourself?

1108
01:45:21,731 --> 01:45:23,348
Come and have a look.

1109
01:45:23,608 --> 01:45:25,141
- Look again!
- Leave me alone!

1110
01:45:47,507 --> 01:45:49,791
Take Sabine to Madame Odile's.

1111
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,710
Look Mummy,
I've finished it all of!

1112
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:54,754
After her homework?

1113
01:45:54,973 --> 01:45:56,631
No, right after she eats.

1114
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,122
And the homework?

1115
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:00,969
She'll do it at Madame Odile's.

1116
01:46:01,187 --> 01:46:02,178
Alright, Madame.

1117
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:30,284
A token, please.

1118
01:48:53,652 --> 01:48:54,475
Odile?

1119
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:00,273
I want to thank you for everything.

1120
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:03,484
I'm of for a rest tomorrow.

1121
01:49:04,412 --> 01:49:07,363
Ask Franca,
can I see Sabine before I go?

1122
01:49:07,582 --> 01:49:11,159
As you wish, Pierre.
But it's such a mess.

1123
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:15,747
What can I do about it now?

1124
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:17,957
It's too late.

1125
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:23,171
Since you'll be seeing her,
would you

1126
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:25,590
Let me know?

1127
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:27,759
Let you know what?

1128
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:32,597
If you can still change your mind?

1129
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:37,477
If you really want to go back
to Franca,

1130
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:41,314
I'm sure she'd agree,
if you ask her yourself.

1131
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:43,816
You may be right, Odile.

1132
01:49:45,453 --> 01:49:46,903
I'll do it next week.

1133
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:50,980
Why? The sooner the better.
Call her right now.

1134
01:49:51,209 --> 01:49:52,450
Now?

1135
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:56,579
I'd rather wait awhile.

1136
01:49:56,798 --> 01:50:01,084
What for? Do you think
she'll sit around for 10 years?

1137
01:50:02,512 --> 01:50:05,672
Pierre, I beg you,
don't put it of.

1138
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:08,383
You're probably right.

1139
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:11,844
I guess I'll do that.

1140
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:24,232
- Another token, please.
- One more?

1141
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:25,775
That's right.

1142
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:52,278
I'm going out.

1143
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:54,280
Will you lunch here?

1144
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:38,574
Madame Lachenay's place.

1145
01:52:40,212 --> 01:52:41,953
Is this you, Mademoiselle?

1146
01:52:42,672 --> 01:52:45,832
- My wife, please.
- She just this minute went out.

1147
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:49,752
Look in the hall.

1148
01:52:50,388 --> 01:52:52,755
Hold on, sir. I'll see.

1149
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:08,021
No, she's left the house.

1150
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:12,014
Then, she"s in the street.
Call her from the window.

1151
01:53:12,244 --> 01:53:13,860
I'll have a look.

1152
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:49,562
I'm sorry, but her car
just pulled out. Any message?

1153
01:53:50,156 --> 01:53:54,484
Tell Madame that I phoned
and will call back later.

1154
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:56,361
I'll tell her, sir.

1155
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:57,153
That's all.

1156
01:56:55,425 --> 01:56:57,959

Good morning. Please, tell
Monsieur MahÈ that I'm here.

40
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:44,072
Of course, sir.

41
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,641
Monsieur MahÈ,
Mister Jardine is here.

42
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:51,043
He's waiting for you downstairs.

43
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:53,446
Monsieur MahÈ
will be right down.

44
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:56,781
So today's the great day?

45
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,946
Come on, don't be so mysterious.
Everybody knows.

46
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,286
Don't people have
anything else to do?

47
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:05,453
- Is what they say true?
- I don't know what they say.

48
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,462
They say he's never seen
his bride.

49
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,464
That he doesn't even know
what she looks like.

50
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:12,524
Of course he does. They must
have exchanged pictures.

51
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:34,218
Here's his breakfast.
He didn't even touch it.

52
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,986
There, you see how excited
he is, Monsieur Jardine.

53
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,429
You know, one of my aunts
got married by correspondence.

54
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:43,125
I'm all packed.

55
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,497
I'll send someone to pick up
the bags and pay the bill.

56
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:47,763
- Did you go by the house?
- Yes, the blinds came.

57
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,771
We're not going to be late,
are we?

58
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,139
I'll go with you as far as Ling Wo's.
You can drop me off there.

59
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:57,612
- Whose?
- The jeweller.

60
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:02,281
Did you know that out of
the 14 jewellers in this town...

61
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:04,752
eleven are Chinese,
and three, Creoles?

62
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:08,288
I almost forgot to give you
the bouquet.

63
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:10,417
- What bouquet?
- The bridal bouquet.

64
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:12,688
I completely forgot about it.

65
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:16,095
My wife reminded me
this morning. It's in here.

66
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:30,135
Good-bye. I'll come by
this evening to pay. Thank you.

67
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,112
Here's the ring.

68
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,449
That's the little string
she sent you for the size.

69
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,512
I suppose you'll want to keep it
as a souvenir.

70
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,922
I don't keep souvenirs.
It's the ring that matters.

71
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,964
Excuse me.

72
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,066
Excuse me.

73
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:35,759
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:44,906
Are there any other passengers?

75
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,737
No, Monsieur.
There's nobody else on board.

76
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,743
All the passengers are ashore.

77
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:29,141
Don't you recognize me,
Monsieur MahÈ?

78
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,718
I'm sorry.

79
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,725
What do you mean by that?

80
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:45,766
I am Julie.
I am Julie Roussel.

81
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,963
Julie Roussel?

82
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,097
I don't understand.

83
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,801
You don't think
I'm like my picture?

84
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:59,338
The picture I sent you
wasn't really of me.

85
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,610
It was one of my friends.

86
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:05,917
It's hard to confide
in someone in a letter.

87
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:08,388
I was pleased
with your letters, but--

88
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:10,823
Well, especially at first
I was a bit afraid of you.

89
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:13,728
That's why.

90
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:16,594
But then,
after you had proposed to--

91
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,066
I mean, when you'd asked me
to marry you...

92
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:22,070
I was too embarrassed
to send a real picture of me.

93
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:23,662
And besides,
Berthe, my sister, said...

94
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:26,435
''When Monsieur MahÈ sees you,
he will forgive you.''

95
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,307
Your sister's absolutely right.

96
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:30,902
You're not disappointed?

97
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,781
Look at me. Do I look
disappointed? You see...

98
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:40,951
I thought I'd already come
part of the way...

99
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:42,957
but I'm afraid it's not true.

100
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,425
I'll have to readjust myself
to you.

101
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:48,054
I must learn to know you.

102
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,293
Do you forgive Julie Roussel
for lying?

103
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,631
I find it charming.

104
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:05,176
Your plans?
Will this affect them?

105
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:08,081
- And yours?
- I'm here.

106
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,714
It's difficult, isn't it?

107
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:47,949
What's so difficult?

108
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,618
It's really hard
to get to know someone...

109
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,594
even if we told each other
a lot of things in our letters.

110
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,966
Exactly because we have
told each other a lot...

111
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:07,702
there will surely be
some big silences between us.

112
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:10,177
But that doesn't bother me.

113
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,180
Me neither.

114
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,666
I hope Reunion won't disappoint you.

115
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,738
I don't know New Caledonia.
I've never been to Noumea.

116
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,966
Where you're from
is a long strip of land.

117
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:42,408
Very long.

118
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,379
Whereas Reunion is shaped
like an egg.

119
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,575
By the way, do you know
how Reunion was populated?

120
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,049
No.

121
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:51,985
Three hundred years ago,
there was hardly anyone.

122
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:54,887
And Colbert,
who'd founded the India Company...

123
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,152
decided to send 1,000 settlers...

124
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:59,057
and 32 women.

125
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,426
During the voyage
there were many storms...

126
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:03,328
and a scurvy epidemic.

127
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,526
So when the boat docked...

128
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:08,593
there were many dead bodies
and sick people too.

129
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:10,832
And among the 32 women...

130
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:14,842
the only five remaining
got married within three months.

131
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,175
And one of them
was my great-great grandmother.

132
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:21,273
Who were these women?
Did they come here to marry?

133
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,716
I doubt anyone asked their opinion.

134
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,845
Many came from La Rochelle.

135
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:28,754
They were orphans, like you.

136
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,559
But I'm not sure
they were as beautiful.

137
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:59,543
This is our house.
This is where we'll live.

138
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,249
Our house?

139
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:03,587
Yes, I have a confession
to make.

140
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,627
I didn't tell you everything
in my letters.

141
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:09,061
- I'm afraid that I even lied.
- What do you mean you lied?

142
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,895
I told you that I was a foreman
in a factory making cigarettes.

143
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,195
Yes, you did.

144
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,363
That's not true.
I'm the owner of the factory.

145
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:20,000
I inherited it when my parents
died three years ago.

146
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,943
I'm not proud of myself
for hiding it...

147
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:25,674
but I hoped money
wouldn't enter into it.

148
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:28,649
I'm afraid your lie
is much nicer than mine.

149
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,844
- I hope you're not angry.
- No, Monsieur.

150
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,444
Not Monsieur, Louis.

151
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,546
No, Louis, it's not important
at all.

152
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:37,023
Besides,
I don't understand business.

153
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,990
Louis MahÈ...

154
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:43,589
do you take for your lawfully
wedded wife, Julie Roussel...

155
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,464
here present,
according to the rites...

156
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,060
of our mother, the Holy Church?

157
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,469
I do.

158
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:54,908
Julie Roussel, do you take for
your lawfully wedded husband...

159
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:57,502
Louis MahÈ, here present...

160
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,845
according to the rites
of our mother, the Holy Church?

161
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,974
I do.

162
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,541
I now pronounce you
man and wife...

163
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,520
in the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

164
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:08,113
Amen.

165
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,090
You may kiss the bride.

166
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,577
What's the matter?

167
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,547
What's wrong with you?

168
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:22,049
What's wrong?

169
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:24,517
Julie, answer me!

170
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,713
What is it?

171
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,304
There.

172
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,252
Any better?

173
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:06,419
Yes.

174
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:11,295
Yes, I'm much better.

175
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,966
It seemed you were having
trouble breathing.

176
00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:16,902
Yes.

177
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:20,032
- Has this happened before?
- Yes.

178
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:26,704
I was embarrassed to tell you...

179
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:32,077
I'm unable to sleep
without a lamp on.

180
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:34,884
I can't sleep in the dark!

181
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:37,721
You should've said so.
It's simple.

182
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:39,727
We'll leave
the lamp on the table lit.

183
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:44,198
No, it's too bright.
It might keep you awake.

184
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,564
Shall I leave the light
in the bathroom on?

185
00:20:46,635 --> 00:20:48,466
Yes, would you, please?

186
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:53,036
There we are.

187
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:55,906
- Is that better?
- Yes.

188
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:58,845
You're like those little
children who can't sleep...

189
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:01,542
without a door open
or a light on.

190
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:04,051
And who say, ''Leave the door
open a little wider...

191
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,384
a little more, more.

192
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:10,084
There, like that.''

193
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,095
You've had enough of
this little cage, haven't you?

194
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:22,501
You'll be happier in here.

195
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,107
Look, no, come on.

196
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,669
That one's better.

197
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:31,611
Come here, come here.
Come on.

198
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,773
It's bigger than this one.

199
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:43,955
Here we go. That's right.
Get on your perch.

200
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,128
That's better, huh?

201
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,579
I'd like you to meet my wife.

202
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,782
Do you already know my wife?

203
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:18,884
Please allow me
to introduce my wife.

204
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,895
I believe you know my wife.

205
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:22,931
You've met my charming wife?

206
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,431
Here she is now.

207
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,297
Please allow me
to introduce her.

208
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:29,303
- She's charming, ravishing--
- Louis, you are crazy!

209
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,734
Thank you, Sarah.
Don't forget my canary.

210
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,746
Louis, breakfast.

211
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:48,951
Why are you having coffee?

212
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:51,049
It'll only take a minute
for Sarah to make tea.

213
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:53,720
No, no, I love coffee.

214
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:57,060
Oh, really. I remember
that in one of your letters...

215
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,191
you told me
that you preferred tea.

216
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:01,759
I wrote a lot of things.

217
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:07,307
Are you still planning
to show me the factory tomorrow?

218
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:10,311
Absolutely. You must meet
all the personnel.

219
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,609
I am so proud of you.

220
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:15,081
But I have nothing to wear.

221
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,118
What about the trunk
that just came?

222
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:20,484
My trunk?
Oh, it's only old things.

223
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:23,992
Well, you must open it
sometime.

224
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:26,961
I've lost the key.

225
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,020
Call a locksmith.

226
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:30,997
But it's Sunday.

227
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:34,502
That's right. It's Sunday.
I'd forgotten all about it.

228
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:46,112
When my grandfather owned this
plantation, it was much bigger.

229
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:49,082
But it has been divided
among his heirs.

230
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,619
Aren't they pretty? I didn't
know that tobacco had flowers.

231
00:23:51,687 --> 00:23:54,815
Oh, yes. When they're in bloom,
they're no good anymore.

232
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,188
There, you see?
They are uprooting them now.

233
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:59,193
Do you make your cigarettes
out of this tobacco?

234
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,889
It's mixed
with five other tobaccos...

235
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:04,797
which come from Madagascar
and the West Indies.

236
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:33,422
Look, Monsieur Louis,
Madame Julie's bird is dead.

237
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,038
Julie, are you there?

238
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,140
Yes, I'm taking a bath.

239
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:58,550
- I have bad news.
- What is it?

240
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,713
Your canary's dead.

241
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:04,953
That doesn't surprise me a bit.
He hasn't been himself for days.

242
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:57,106
Louis, can you help me
button up my dress?

243
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,114
I can never manage it.

244
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,556
I wonder why I wear this dress,
I can never button it up.

245
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:17,427
There.

246
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,524
It's my favourite,
do you like it?

247
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:23,730
Yes. The lace is nice.

248
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:27,398
It's embroidery, it's not lace.

249
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:33,807
You seem very far away today.

250
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:38,216
Oh, no, even if I wanted to,
I couldn't be far away.

251
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:58,806
You are adorable.

252
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:20,092
Wait, wait. Come over here
under the Wishing Tree.

253
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:21,754
- The Wishing Tree?
- Yes.

254
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,525
What's that?

255
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,361
I'll tell you all about it.

256
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:27,594
Sit down.

257
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:28,863
There.

258
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:32,497
It's a very old
family tradition.

259
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:37,068
Whenever we make a wish
under this tree, it's granted.

260
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,308
Really? I'm going to make a wish
here too, then.

261
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:41,872
So will I.

262
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:45,515
- Well, I already made mine.
- So did I.

263
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:48,852
- Wouldn't it be funny if we--
- If we made the same wish?

264
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:01,728
Here, take this note in.

265
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,115
Let me go, you bastard!

266
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,212
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

267
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:04,690
- This is a huge bank.
- Yes. There are 164 employees.

268
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,490
Of the 47 banks on the island,
this is the biggest one.

269
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:10,758
I'd better ask the cashier.

270
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,562
Monsieur Hoareau, please?

271
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,466
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Monsieur MahÈ.

272
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:18,097
I'm sorry
if I kept you waiting.

273
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:21,606
Madame.

274
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:22,938
How are you, sir?

275
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:25,639
I was trimming the Christmas
tree for the staff.

276
00:30:26,982 --> 00:30:29,212
And how can I help you?

277
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:33,653
I would like my wife to have
complete access to my account.

278
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,713
Nothing could be easier.
All we have to do is...

279
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,657
change your present account
to a joint account.

280
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:41,890
To do that I shall need
both your signatures.

281
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,828
Yours on the bottom
of this form...

282
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:45,593
giving us the authorization.

283
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:48,295
And yours, Madame,
on this signature card...

284
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,099
so that we will have it on file.

285
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:52,662
My wife and money
don't get along at all.

286
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:56,006
She's too shy to keep asking me
when she needs it.

287
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:57,704
So we thought--

288
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,974
That is, I thought,
it would be easier like this.

289
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:02,949
Absolutely. But I'd like
to clarify one other thing.

290
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:06,784
Will these conditions apply to your
personal account or to both accounts?

291
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:08,846
- I think the personal one.
- Yes, yes, of course.

292
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:10,220
No, both.

293
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,418
In that case, will you sign
this second power of attorney?

294
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,895
I've heard a lot about how
beautiful you are, Madame...

295
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:20,400
but I see
they were understatements.

296
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:24,165
I hope you and Madame Hoareau
will join us for dinner at home.

297
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:26,764
You too, Monsieur Jardine,
with Madame.

298
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:50,396
- What day is it today?
- Friday.

299
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:52,558
I was hoping it was Sunday.

300
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:55,034
Before I met you,
I didn't like holidays...

301
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:58,129
and now I'm beginning to hate
the days when I have to work.

302
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:14,980
Julie, you are adorable.

303
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:18,648
You know what that means?
''Adorable.''

304
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:21,661
It means ''worthy of adoration.''

305
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,355
Adorable.

306
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:22,389
I have a registered letter
for you.

307
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,898
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.

308
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:46,809
Monsieur MahÈ,
Since my sister Julie left...

309
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:50,146
l have written four times
without any reply.

310
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:52,345
Something must have happened
to her.

311
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,047
I demand an explanation.

312
00:33:54,122 --> 00:33:56,386
I must know
where my sister is.

313
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:59,017
I'm writing to you
as a last resort.

314
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:02,551
Let me know immediately
where she is.

315
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,621
Prove to me
that nothing's the matter.

316
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:08,157
I want you to see that she gets
in touch with me at once.

317
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:11,467
If not, I'll go to the police.
Berthe Roussel.

318
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,376
Get me Madame MahÈ.

319
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:27,578
Monsieur Berber is wanted
in Accounting.

320
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,384
Madame MahÈ is on the phone.

321
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,588
That's fine. Leave me alone.

322
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:45,229
-Julie?
- Yes.

323
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,536
There's something
you must tell me.

324
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,304
I've just received a letter
from your sister.

325
00:34:49,377 --> 00:34:51,971
She complains that you haven't
written since you left.

326
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,276
Ah yes, that's true.
She's perfectly right.

327
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:56,078
Iíve been about to write
a dozen times...

328
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,947
but something always comes up.

329
00:34:58,019 --> 00:34:59,884
Getting everything
running smoothly--

330
00:34:59,954 --> 00:35:02,923
But after all, Julie,
she's your sister.

331
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:06,017
And besides, the tone of
her letter is extremely violent.

332
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:08,619
That doesn't surprise me.
Iíll write her tomorrow.

333
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:11,062
But why tomorrow?
You must write now.

334
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,929
Yes. That's right.
That's what Iíll do.

335
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:14,400
- Good-bye, Julie.
- Wait.

336
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:16,664
Wait. Iím thinking about you.

337
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:18,228
Me too.

338
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:20,365
- l miss you.
- Me too.

339
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,841
- Very much.
- Me too.

340
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:49,669
Julie.

341
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,800
Julie.

342
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:05,684
- Sarah, have you seen Madame?
- No, Monsieur.

343
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,466
l would like my wife to have
complete access to my account.

344
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:03,470
Nothing could be easier.

345
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:12,211
l must speak
to Monsieur Hoareau.

346
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,248
itís very important,
l absolutely must speak to him.

347
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:16,476
The bank is closed.

348
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,485
itís me, Louis MahÈ.
l must speak to you.

349
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:20,817
Jeremy, let Monsieur MahÈ in.

350
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:27,489
itís very important. l must know
how much is in my account.

351
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:29,223
l don't understand,
Monsieur MahÈ.

352
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:32,528
No one can touch your money,
except you and your wife.

353
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,127
The cashier can give you this
information tomorrow morning.

354
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:39,002
l can't wait.
Look in the files yourself.

355
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:43,239
This morning you had
28 million in your account.

356
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:46,838
l know that. l knew it already.
Tell me how much is in it now!

357
00:38:48,716 --> 00:38:52,083
Your wife came in this afternoon
15 minutes before closing time.

358
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:55,987
She withdrew 27,850,000 francs.

359
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:58,651
You have therefore
150,000 francs.

360
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:00,353
To close out the account...

361
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:02,453
we would have required
your signature, too.

362
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:46,092
- Monsieur MahÈ?
- Yes.

363
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,601
I am Berthe Roussel,
Julie's sister.

364
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:54,130
I don't know anything.
You see, I've just closed the house.

365
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:58,008
You won't need your taxi.
We can go into town in my car.

366
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,552
No, that's not my sister.
It's incredible.

367
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,079
As soon as l opened
that trunk...

368
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:09,412
l realized that the things
that were in it...

369
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:12,941
could have never belonged
to the woman I had married.

370
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,480
I rushed to the bank,
the Bank of Reunion...

371
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:21,585
and as I expected, she had
disappeared during the day.

372
00:42:21,662 --> 00:42:23,596
She took everything.

373
00:42:23,664 --> 00:42:25,859
She cleaned out
both my accounts.

374
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:29,801
The company's account
and my personal account.

375
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,967
Naturally, I assume you went
straight to the police.

376
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:37,670
I did. But the police,
I'm afraid, are powerless...

377
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:40,339
to act against her because
I'm married to the woman.

378
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:42,712
Unless we can prove she is not
the real Julie Roussel.

379
00:42:42,783 --> 00:42:45,217
I can prove it.

380
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:48,414
The woman who married
Monsieur MahÈ is not my sister.

381
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:52,016
I took my sister to the boat.
I saw her off on the Mississippi.

382
00:42:52,093 --> 00:42:55,460
When the boat arrived here,
she was not on board.

383
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:57,656
It is clear
she never came ashore.

384
00:42:57,732 --> 00:43:00,394
She would never have gone
so long without writing me.

385
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:04,336
I'm afraid that there is no hope
of finding her alive.

386
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:06,339
What do you expect me to do?

387
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:10,809
Forgive me
for speaking brutally.

388
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:14,642
We want you to find the proof
that there was a murder.

389
00:43:14,715 --> 00:43:17,684
We want you to find the criminal
and to arrest her.

390
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:21,950
- We want her brought to trial.
- I accept.

391
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:25,657
This case
interests me very much.

392
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:29,594
It's not run-of-the-mill
like the ones I usually get.

393
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:33,530
I must warn you, however,
that I can't tell you...

394
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:36,263
how much time it will take me
to solve this case.

395
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:38,965
I can promise you that I only
accept one case at a time...

396
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,305
and I'll keep working on it
until I have solved it.

397
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:45,811
To begin with...

398
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,475
I shall take the same trip
that Julie Roussel took.

399
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,313
I shall book passage
on the Mississippi...

400
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:53,216
and inquire everybody...

401
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:56,347
about a woman passenger
who made the trip with a canary.

402
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:04,555
Of course I must be able
to contact one of you.

403
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:06,156
I'm going to be away
for a while.

404
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:08,098
I think somewhere
in the South of France.

405
00:44:08,169 --> 00:44:10,637
My partner, Monsieur Jardine,
will always know where I am.

406
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:13,172
I'm leaving for Noumea today.
Here is my address.

407
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,300
I'll write you a check.
How much will you need?

408
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:17,901
Make it out
for whatever you wish.

409
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:21,141
- If it isn't enough--
-Just a second.

410
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:22,944
Oh no, you mustn't,
Mademoiselle Roussel.

411
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:24,882
It's up to me to pay for this.

412
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:27,386
Please, this is no time to be
polite. She was my sister...

413
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:29,479
and it's my right
to share the expenses with you.

414
00:44:29,557 --> 00:44:31,787
You can't take that
away from me.

415
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:44,102
If you don't mind, I will have
to cut up this picture.

416
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:47,140
I'll need it
for my investigation.

417
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:51,907
We will see each other again,
Monsieur MahÈ.

418
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:57,480
We'll see each other again
one of these days, I'm sure.

419
00:44:57,551 --> 00:45:00,952
There's no point
in having people gossip.

420
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,319
At the end of every week...

421
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,153
I'll send you all the news
of the factory.

422
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:09,720
General Delivery in Marseilles,
until you have an address.

423
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:13,324
A Boeing. Out of the six flights
every week...

424
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,460
there are four Boeings
and two D.C. 8's.

425
00:45:16,537 --> 00:45:18,471
Have a good rest.

426
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,018
What am I doing here?

427
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:24,030
You're in a hospital,
Monsieur MahÈ. In Nice.

428
00:47:24,098 --> 00:47:27,397
- Have you been to Nice before?
- But why am I here?

429
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:31,564
You were exhausted.
You've been having a sleeping cure.

430
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:34,402
If I'm having a sleeping cure,
why do you wake me all the time?

431
00:47:34,475 --> 00:47:37,603
- We've got to feed you.
- I'm not hungry.

432
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:40,977
Let me help you walk a bit.
If we don't, you'll get too weak.

433
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:45,085
I don't feel very rested...

434
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:47,143
because I have these dreams
all the time.

435
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:49,689
That's because of the shots
we have to give you.

436
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:51,554
What do you dream?

437
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,752
It's always the same dream.

438
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:56,853
I'm driving my car and I see
all the these women in white...

439
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,728
very tall, and they're
in the middle of the road...

440
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,064
waving their arms,
not frightened.

441
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:06,072
No. It's more like-- more like
they are doing a slow dance.

442
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,233
And I'm afraid
I'm going to hit them.

443
00:48:09,743 --> 00:48:12,075
That's enough for now. You're
walking better than yesterday.

444
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:14,114
You'll be able to go out
in the garden soon.

445
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:15,842
Come and lie down.

446
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:31,654
- Would you like a newspaper?
- No newspaper, thank you.

447
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:33,256
Are you expecting a visitor?

448
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,528
No, I don't know anybody
in France.

449
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:40,433
And that is all
the political news for now.

450
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:42,668
Next, a few items
of local interest.

451
00:48:42,743 --> 00:48:45,769
A new night club has just opened
on the Riviera...

452
00:48:45,846 --> 00:48:48,974
where the people from Antibes
can spend a happy evening.

453
00:48:49,049 --> 00:48:52,018
The Phoenix recently opened
to the public...

454
00:48:52,086 --> 00:48:54,020
on the lovely
Jacques Audiberti Square.

455
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:55,885
Charming hostesses
are on hand to dance...

456
00:48:55,956 --> 00:48:59,949
with those unlucky gentlemen
who may be feeling lonely.

457
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:04,088
Here then is the swinging
atmosphere at the Phoenix.

458
00:51:21,902 --> 00:51:24,769
Good evening, sir.
Care to take a little look inside?

459
00:53:35,163 --> 00:53:36,858
That's enough. Go home now.

460
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:39,127
- Oh no, you said ''to the door.''
- No, no, to the stairs.

461
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:40,930
Why can't I come to the door?

462
00:53:41,003 --> 00:53:44,495
All right,
but I don't want you to--

463
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:46,268
Better than that.
Come on, better than that.

464
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:49,640
- You'll ruin my stockings.
- I'll buy you a dozen pairs.

465
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:51,508
- Go on.
- I just want to come in.

466
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,548
- No, no, some other time.
- Some other time?

467
00:53:53,615 --> 00:53:55,879
- Tomorrow night, then.
- Maybe, we'll see.

468
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:33,180
It's you, Louis?

469
00:54:33,255 --> 00:54:35,382
You've found me.

470
00:54:35,457 --> 00:54:36,719
Yes.

471
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:43,330
Why didn't you let that man
come in with you?

472
00:54:43,398 --> 00:54:44,729
Not enough money for you?

473
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:49,532
Do you remember what I told you
about Reunion?

474
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:52,835
About how it was populated
at first?

475
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:56,969
I told you about all those women
who'd come from France by boat.

476
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:59,036
Orphans, just like you.

477
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:03,346
Except that's only
what the guide books say.

478
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,978
For the tourists.

479
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:08,784
If you take a look at the records,
you'll find out...

480
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:12,793
they weren't orphans,
but prostitutes.

481
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:16,194
Did you come all the way here
to tell me that?

482
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:21,527
I came here to kill you.

483
00:55:22,437 --> 00:55:23,995
Turn around.

484
00:55:25,941 --> 00:55:30,878
You can kill me.
I'm willing to die.

485
00:55:32,948 --> 00:55:34,939
I'm waiting.

486
00:55:35,017 --> 00:55:37,611
I don't mind if you kill me.

487
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,888
Put this on.
You're almost naked.

488
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:50,087
Ever since you left, I've dreamt
of coming face to face with you.

489
00:55:50,165 --> 00:55:54,101
I've never asked myself whether
it would be easy to kill you.

490
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,001
I'm finding out it's not.

491
00:56:00,475 --> 00:56:03,706
A pistol doesn't work by magic.

492
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:05,576
There is a trigger.

493
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:07,410
I'm incapable of pulling it.

494
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:09,712
You're going to turn me over
to the police?

495
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:12,253
- Yes.
- No.

496
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,288
I'd have let you kill me,
but I'm not going to prison.

497
00:56:14,356 --> 00:56:17,587
I won't go back to prison.
Now you're going to listen to me.

498
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:19,354
Will you sit there
and not interrupt me?

499
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:20,861
Yes, Julie.

500
00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:22,863
No, don't call me Julie.
It's not my name.

501
00:56:22,931 --> 00:56:25,229
My name is Marion Vergano.

502
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,098
Remember. One day
you were angry with me...

503
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,468
because I wouldn't read a book
you wanted me to read.

504
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:34,373
You said I wasted my time on
trash like True Confessions.

505
00:56:34,443 --> 00:56:39,142
But my life was just like
the lives in those cheap magazines.

506
00:56:39,214 --> 00:56:42,843
Marion was the name somebody
gave me at the state orphanage.

507
00:56:42,918 --> 00:56:45,512
Vergano I found
on an Italian postcard.

508
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:47,487
It's the name of a village.

509
00:56:48,623 --> 00:56:50,454
When you get out
of the orphanage...

510
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:53,722
you are either brainwashed,
or completely rebellious.

511
00:56:53,795 --> 00:56:55,763
I threw myself into life.

512
00:56:55,831 --> 00:56:59,392
At fourteen, I got my first high
heels. A man bought them for me.

513
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:04,327
I got a job as a maid, so
I'd check the shoes in a bar...

514
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:06,806
and pick them up
on my next day off.

515
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,308
As soon as I got a new job...

516
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:12,210
I'd begin by lifting the change
from my boss's pocket.

517
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,215
Then I'd go on to the bills
in his wallet...

518
00:57:15,283 --> 00:57:18,309
and finally wind up by
leaving with the wallet itself.

519
00:57:19,955 --> 00:57:22,583
They sent me to reform schools,
each one tougher than the last.

520
00:57:22,657 --> 00:57:25,285
We had to undress before
going into the dormitory...

521
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,329
and leave our clothes
in the hall.

522
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:30,387
They locked the dormitory doors.

523
00:57:30,465 --> 00:57:33,059
Even the windows were sealed.

524
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:36,263
Between the guard's rounds,
we'd have a masturbation contest.

525
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:39,733
But the hardest part at first,
was to get used...

526
00:57:39,808 --> 00:57:42,538
to sleeping with the light on
all night.

527
00:57:44,913 --> 00:57:47,438
I've never been able to sleep
in the dark since.

528
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:52,581
I was pretty,
I could manage boys well.

529
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:55,179
I got what I wanted...

530
00:57:55,257 --> 00:57:58,090
until the day
that I met Richard.

531
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:02,219
I was with him
on the Mississippi...

532
00:58:02,297 --> 00:58:04,731
at the same time
as Julie Roussel.

533
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,357
Richard loved big boats.

534
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:09,028
There's always some con game
you can pull on them.

535
00:58:10,205 --> 00:58:14,972
So we met Julie Roussel,
your fiancÈe...

536
00:58:15,043 --> 00:58:17,102
and she confided in me.

537
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:21,411
She told me everything,
the exchange of letters...

538
00:58:21,483 --> 00:58:24,941
your future marriage,
she even showed me your picture.

539
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,612
At that moment, she said...

540
00:58:26,688 --> 00:58:31,057
''He wants me to believe he is
a foreman in a cigarette factory.

541
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:32,753
But I've done
some investigating.

542
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:35,489
And I've found out
the factory belongs to him.''

543
00:58:35,564 --> 00:58:37,395
She wasn't exactly
a plaster saint...

544
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:39,365
your Julie Roussel
with her canary.

545
00:58:40,902 --> 00:58:43,962
At first, Richard planned to
use her to get at your money...

546
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,736
but it seemed too complicated.

547
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:50,209
He decided to get rid of her.

548
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:54,973
So one night
he pushed her overboard.

549
00:58:56,251 --> 00:58:58,811
That was two days before
we got to Reunion.

550
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:07,659
Richard made me do
the craziest things imaginable.

551
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:09,390
But he overdid himself
when he asked me...

552
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:12,126
to take the place
of Julie Roussel.

553
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:17,699
The first time when I saw you
when I got off the Mississippi...

554
00:59:17,772 --> 00:59:22,232
I should have been in agony
or paralysed by fright.

555
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,802
Actually I felt nothing.
I was like a sleepwalker.

556
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,508
The rest I know.

557
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:31,711
You put on your act with me
from morning till night.

558
00:59:31,786 --> 00:59:33,447
Right up till you cleaned out
the accounts at the bank.

559
00:59:33,521 --> 00:59:36,217
No, that's not true. You don't
have the right to say that.

560
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:39,260
When I became your wife I tried
to be just like any other wife.

561
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:43,286
I tried to push out of my mind
what Richard wanted me to do.

562
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:47,233
When Richard came on shore
I didn't get in touch with him.

563
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:50,066
But of course it was easy
for him to find your address.

564
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:52,402
He bothered me constantly.

565
00:59:52,474 --> 00:59:56,171
Remember once you came home and
found me with a swollen face?

566
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:58,610
I made you believe that
I had fallen in the bathroom.

567
01:00:00,148 --> 01:00:02,639
He blackmailed me
and finally I gave in.

568
01:00:02,717 --> 01:00:04,548
I didn't want him
to turn me over to the police.

569
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:07,383
I thought he might kill us,
both, because he's mad.

570
01:00:08,923 --> 01:00:12,324
Where's the money?
What have you done with it?

571
01:00:12,394 --> 01:00:14,828
Richard took it
and dropped me afterward.

572
01:00:16,531 --> 01:00:18,624
You don't believe me?

573
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,565
Do you think I'd be a dance hall
hostess at the Phoenix...

574
01:00:20,635 --> 01:00:23,195
if I still had the 27 million?

575
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:30,176
I have no money at all, Louis.
That's the truth.

576
01:00:30,245 --> 01:00:33,510
I was just waiting to make
enough money at the Phoenix...

577
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:36,516
to get my ticket to Paris.

578
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:39,178
I've always thought
that I'd be lucky in Paris.

579
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:41,950
And besides I'm fed up here.

580
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:45,515
I went to see you at the Phoenix
one night.

581
01:00:45,593 --> 01:00:49,290
I hid in a corner
and watched you.

582
01:00:49,364 --> 01:00:51,457
I watched you dancing
with those other guys.

583
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:55,268
And your face had such
an expression of joy...

584
01:00:55,337 --> 01:00:57,805
it was incredible.

585
01:00:57,872 --> 01:01:00,466
An expression
that I'd never seen before.

586
01:01:03,044 --> 01:01:07,447
I knew then I had given you nothing.
That I had no place in your life.

587
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:08,948
You're absolutely wrong, Louis.

588
01:01:09,017 --> 01:01:11,417
I loved you
from the first minute we met.

589
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:15,081
A hundred times
I started to tell you.

590
01:01:15,156 --> 01:01:19,217
I always stopped at the last
moment because I'm a coward.

591
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:25,154
You do whatever you want,
but I did love you...

592
01:01:26,368 --> 01:01:28,233
I'm not really bad--

593
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:34,968
Wait.

594
01:01:35,043 --> 01:01:36,977
I'm waiting.

595
01:01:37,045 --> 01:01:39,070
I still love you.

596
01:01:40,148 --> 01:01:41,581
I believe you.

597
01:01:41,649 --> 01:01:43,708
No, it's not true.
You don't believe me.

598
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:47,949
Yes, I believe you...

599
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:49,956
and I love you.

600
01:01:58,032 --> 01:02:01,160
Look, Marion, the grey one.
That wouldn't be bad.

601
01:02:01,236 --> 01:02:03,295
Look at the red convertible.
It's super.

602
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:05,271
No, the red one would be
too conspicuous.

603
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,137
We'd better get the grey.

604
01:02:08,343 --> 01:02:10,140
Isn't there anything else?

605
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:16,742
Too bad. I prefer the red one.

606
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,911
No, Marion, we'll take the grey.

607
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,527
Will they be upset at the club
when I don't up show tonight?

608
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:37,336
Paris is 813 kilometers.
That's not very far.

609
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:41,136
No. If we drove all day,
we could be there tonight.

610
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:44,235
What's stopping us from going?
You promised to show me Paris.

611
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:46,974
No, it's not possible, Marion.

612
01:02:47,048 --> 01:02:50,381
You mustn't forget Comolli,
that detective from Reunion.

613
01:02:50,452 --> 01:02:52,249
He must still be on the case.

614
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,049
And even in a city like Paris...

615
01:02:54,122 --> 01:02:58,183
you're forced to fill out
a registration at all the hotels.

616
01:02:58,259 --> 01:03:02,423
I bet it was Jardine who told
you to go to that detective.

617
01:03:02,497 --> 01:03:06,797
It was Julie's sister,
Berthe Roussel.

618
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:09,996
It's true. Anyway, Jardine
never gives anybody advice.

619
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:12,130
He just hands out the figures.

620
01:03:12,207 --> 01:03:15,438
Know what he said to me
the day we got married?

621
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,877
He told me, ''Out of 89 religious
establishments in Reunion...

622
01:03:18,947 --> 01:03:23,281
there are 62 Catholic parishes,
twenty pagodas...

623
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:27,651
three mosques,
and four Adventist temples.''

624
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:32,289
If we can't go to a hotel,
we'll rent a house.

625
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,885
But it's so much work.
You need servants.

626
01:03:34,963 --> 01:03:38,455
I can keep a house on my own,
you know.

627
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:41,263
I can do the housework,
the cooking, and the--

628
01:03:41,336 --> 01:03:43,201
And the dishes,
and the washing.

629
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:45,933
Of course!
You'll see, I'll surprise you.

630
01:03:46,007 --> 01:03:48,305
That's right. Surprise me.

631
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,884
There, that's the house.

632
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:02,113
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

633
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,988
There. The woman
from the agency is waiting.

634
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:08,825
You know who she looks like?
Olive, Popeye's girl.

635
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:15,659
Madame and Monsieur MahÈ,
I presume.

636
01:04:15,737 --> 01:04:17,864
Follow me, please,
I'll show you the house.

637
01:04:17,939 --> 01:04:19,600
I'm sure it will suit you
very well.

638
01:04:19,674 --> 01:04:22,199
You're lucky. You got here
just in time for the sunset.

639
01:04:22,277 --> 01:04:24,245
It's marvellous from the terrace.

640
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,381
I think you'll be very happy here.
The house is charming.

641
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,214
It's not very big
but it'll be fine for the two of you.

642
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:34,221
You'll see.
It's a little ''home, sweet home.''

643
01:04:34,289 --> 01:04:37,690
Here the owner had started to put in
a bar, but he never finished it.

644
01:04:37,759 --> 01:04:40,091
There you have a chimney
that works remarkably well.

645
01:04:40,161 --> 01:04:43,062
There's plenty of wood.
You'll need it with this weather.

646
01:04:43,131 --> 01:04:46,567
There's a very practical little piece
of furniture with a lamp...

647
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:49,535
and there's the library
with lots of books.

648
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:53,062
The owner will unfortunately
have to come for them soon.

649
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:55,109
I think I've told you everything.

650
01:04:55,176 --> 01:04:57,474
I'll give you the inventory.

651
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:58,944
- Good-bye, Madame.
- Good-bye.

652
01:04:59,013 --> 01:05:00,207
Good-bye, Monsieur.

653
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:03,409
If you need anything, just call me at
the agency. I'm there every afternoon.

654
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,884
Just ask for Madame Doyle.

655
01:05:24,072 --> 01:05:27,269
So, what do you think of
our little ''home, sweet home''?

656
01:05:27,342 --> 01:05:30,004
Yeah, what a character!
What was her name again?

657
01:05:30,078 --> 01:05:31,636
Madame Dahl?

658
01:05:31,713 --> 01:05:34,273
- No. Madame Doyle.
- Oh, right.

659
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:36,943
Doyle sounds kind of like Oyl!

660
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:38,815
Maybe it's ''d'Oyl,'' like nobility.

661
01:05:38,886 --> 01:05:42,788
Madame d'Oyl.
Madame Olive d'Oyl.

662
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:47,988
Tonight, Madame Olive d'Oyl will speak
to her fans, live from our studios.

663
01:05:48,062 --> 01:05:51,998
Hey, why did you brush me off
in front of her?

664
01:05:52,066 --> 01:05:54,796
I didn't see any reason
why she should look at you.

665
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:56,928
I didn't want her to see your thighs.

666
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:00,769
Did that annoy you?

667
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:04,676
No, no.
I rather liked it.

668
01:06:04,746 --> 01:06:07,977
I really wanted you,
right at that moment.

669
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,643
And I've been thinking about it
ever since.

670
01:06:16,924 --> 01:06:20,826
Would you like more coffee?
Even if I make you some toast?

671
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,954
It's time for my little cigar.

672
01:06:26,768 --> 01:06:28,702
Don't take the paper,
I haven't read it.

673
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,738
- There's nothing in it.
- Doesn't matter, let me see.

674
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:33,638
- No, no. There's nothing.
- Come on now, let me see.

675
01:06:34,842 --> 01:06:36,639
What's bothering you?

676
01:06:38,346 --> 01:06:39,608
Oh, that's it.

677
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:43,777
Dangerous criminal captured
after shooting at police.

678
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,916
Is it Richard?
The same one?

679
01:06:47,989 --> 01:06:51,083
That's right. It's him.
I didn't want to upset you.

680
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:56,528
I'm glad he shot at the cops.
Now he'll get at least ten years.

681
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:59,725
You shouldn't wish
ten years in prison on anyone...

682
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:01,530
even someone you don't like.

683
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:05,333
But I don't dislike him,
I hate him.

684
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:12,211
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, I want my brush.

685
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,272
Yeah, yeah, just a pretext,
a pretext.

686
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:18,546
I wish you'd hurry up
and lose your hair.

687
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:22,077
I've always been attracted
by men who are going bald.

688
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:24,920
That's because you never met
your father.

689
01:07:24,992 --> 01:07:27,859
You always have
such complicated explanations.

690
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:31,365
It's not complicated.
It's simple. It's pure logic.

691
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,780
I know what you're looking for.

692
01:07:51,853 --> 01:07:53,787
I've hidden it.

693
01:07:53,855 --> 01:07:56,688
You gotta find it. Go on.

694
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:02,285
Oh no. You're cold, cold,
you're cold.

695
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:04,490
Still very cold.

696
01:08:04,565 --> 01:08:07,591
Absolutely freezing!

697
01:08:09,103 --> 01:08:11,298
That's right
in the middle of Iceland.

698
01:08:11,372 --> 01:08:13,499
You're not helping a bit.

699
01:08:13,574 --> 01:08:16,634
Ah, it might be there,
but it isn't.

700
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:19,009
Oh no, no. Very cold.

701
01:08:20,615 --> 01:08:21,912
Lukewarm.

702
01:08:21,983 --> 01:08:24,008
You're getting a little warmer.

703
01:08:24,085 --> 01:08:27,111
Yes. You're getting hot.
Cold again!

704
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:29,620
- And here?
- Burning.

705
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,158
- Burning, burning.
- There it is! I found it!

706
01:08:32,226 --> 01:08:35,525
- Right, you owe me a penalty.
- You owe me. I found it.

707
01:08:35,596 --> 01:08:37,029
I practically told you
where it was.

708
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:39,225
But that's the game.
You lost, you pay.

709
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,359
- In any case there's a penalty.
- Yes, and you pay now.

710
01:08:41,435 --> 01:08:44,370
Stay here.
I have an idea for the penalty.

711
01:08:44,438 --> 01:08:47,498
First the ribbon. There we are.
Then the curtain.

712
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,525
Here.

713
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,537
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting my sweater on.

714
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:26,102
You might've told me.
Everybody can see you.

715
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,149
- But nobody's around.
- Nobody! There's a car coming.

716
01:09:29,217 --> 01:09:31,481
- That's too bad.
- So it's too bad, eh?

717
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:36,117
The poor guy panicked.

718
01:09:41,863 --> 01:09:43,626
Did you see him?

719
01:09:43,698 --> 01:09:46,861
Anyway, it's your fault.
You stopped here.

720
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:50,702
Your grandfather
was really a wonderful man.

721
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:54,400
Ah, yes, that's right.
Why did you say that?

722
01:09:54,475 --> 01:09:57,000
You're always saying that your
grandfather was a wonderful man.

723
01:09:57,078 --> 01:09:59,706
Yeah, that's right,
he was a wonderful man.

724
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:05,115
- What are you doing?
- I'm closing the shutters.

725
01:10:05,186 --> 01:10:06,915
You're crazy.
It's only four o'clock.

726
01:10:06,988 --> 01:10:08,717
I know it's four o'clock.

727
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,950
Do you have anything
against love in the afternoon?

728
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:13,118
- Against what?
- Against love in the afternoon.

729
01:10:13,194 --> 01:10:14,855
Well, no, but--

730
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:32,271
Listen to this one.
''Farmer, man of few words...

731
01:10:32,346 --> 01:10:36,783
seeks to wed Roman Catholic,
even if physically handicapped.

732
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:39,615
Will answer all.''
Ah, well.

733
01:10:39,687 --> 01:10:41,314
You shouldn't make fun of them.

734
01:10:41,389 --> 01:10:43,880
Obviously, I have my reasons
for feeling this way...

735
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,449
but I think that people
who use these classified ads...

736
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,825
are idealists.

737
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:51,922
In five lines they try
to transform their lives...

738
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:53,933
and on those five lines...

739
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:56,333
they spend hours
writing and rewriting.

740
01:10:56,404 --> 01:11:00,135
They try to put everything
in a few words--

741
01:11:00,207 --> 01:11:04,439
their hopes and their dreams...

742
01:11:04,512 --> 01:11:07,777
their ideas about what
life should be.

743
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:12,249
You know,
I never told you this.

744
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,551
Julie Roussel's letters
were very beautiful.

745
01:11:15,623 --> 01:11:19,582
Beautiful because they were
so full of hope.

746
01:11:21,295 --> 01:11:23,763
In that correspondence
between us...

747
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:28,325
we were trying to create
something permanent...

748
01:11:28,402 --> 01:11:30,370
but you came instead...

749
01:11:31,605 --> 01:11:33,937
and brought the ephemeral.

750
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:39,505
Before I met you,
I thought life was so simple...

751
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,878
but now, I realize
it's not simple.

752
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,878
You mixed everything up.

753
01:11:45,953 --> 01:11:47,853
In a way, it's too bad.

754
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:06,335
No, I can't.

755
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:08,307
Really?

756
01:12:08,376 --> 01:12:10,241
No, please.

757
01:12:11,512 --> 01:12:13,446
I've got to tell you something.

758
01:12:15,182 --> 01:12:18,379
We can't make love for the
time being. At least, I can't.

759
01:12:18,452 --> 01:12:20,920
Even the idea
is unbearable to me.

760
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:27,359
You asked me what was wrong.
That's what it was.

761
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:34,291
It's been agony for me
when it was time to go to bed.

762
01:12:34,368 --> 01:12:36,529
So, I just had to tell you.

763
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,708
I can't tell you what it is
because I don't know myself.

764
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:47,778
I've been through times
like this before.

765
01:12:47,848 --> 01:12:51,477
And I assure you
it isn't any simpler for me.

766
01:12:51,552 --> 01:12:54,043
Maybe it won't last much longer.

767
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:57,856
You must be patient.

768
01:12:59,226 --> 01:13:01,490
Can you?

769
01:13:01,562 --> 01:13:03,723
Yes.

770
01:13:03,798 --> 01:13:06,028
But I want to be close to you.

771
01:13:15,576 --> 01:13:17,840
If I ask you some questions,
will you answer them?

772
01:13:17,912 --> 01:13:19,379
Yes.

773
01:13:19,447 --> 01:13:21,176
Were you in love with many guys?

774
01:13:21,248 --> 01:13:23,876
- Yes.
- How did things end?

775
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:28,047
Sometimes I would leave,
other times, they would.

776
01:13:29,623 --> 01:13:32,786
- Do you have any children?
- No, but--

777
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,919
- You almost did?
- Yes.

778
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:38,362
But I didn't want any, so--

779
01:13:38,432 --> 01:13:40,059
Several times?

780
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:42,401
Yes.

781
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,233
Was it sad?

782
01:13:44,305 --> 01:13:46,136
Sad and awful.

783
01:13:46,207 --> 01:13:48,903
Things don't always turn out well.

784
01:13:48,976 --> 01:13:51,740
And sometimes I told myself
I'd never make love again--

785
01:13:51,812 --> 01:13:54,906
that I'd never let anyone touch me.

786
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,540
And then I'd forget...

787
01:13:57,618 --> 01:13:58,949
fortunately!

788
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:05,416
Ask me some other questions.

789
01:14:05,493 --> 01:14:06,824
No.

790
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:13,431
You're more serious than I am,
but you haven't suffered...

791
01:14:13,501 --> 01:14:15,435
not like I have.

792
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:18,336
- Were you in love with any girls?
- Only one.

793
01:14:18,405 --> 01:14:19,804
Only one?

794
01:14:19,874 --> 01:14:22,604
It must have been important, then.
How old was she?

795
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:24,667
Twenty-three. I was twenty-six.

796
01:14:24,745 --> 01:14:26,269
Why didn't it work out?

797
01:14:26,347 --> 01:14:29,316
You must have wanted to marry her.
She didn't want to?

798
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:32,477
No. Let's talk about something else.
She's dead.

799
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:38,191
It's why after that
I couldn't date any girls.

800
01:14:38,259 --> 01:14:42,127
So I got this idea
to look for a woman by correspondence.

801
01:14:42,196 --> 01:14:45,791
The girl that you loved-- I can easily
imagine that she was better than I.

802
01:14:45,866 --> 01:14:47,094
No, she was far more--

803
01:14:47,168 --> 01:14:48,760
We were going to talk about
something else.

804
01:14:48,836 --> 01:14:50,804
Come on. Don't be sad.

805
01:14:52,006 --> 01:14:54,975
Tomorrow we must go pick up
your dress from the seamstress.

806
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:57,340
No, I don't want that dress anymore.

807
01:14:57,411 --> 01:14:59,436
Oh, don't be like that.
You did want it.

808
01:14:59,513 --> 01:15:01,140
And anyway, it's ready.
We're going.

809
01:15:02,283 --> 01:15:05,446
No. I was dressing for you--

810
01:15:05,519 --> 01:15:10,286
to please you
so you'd want me all the time.

811
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:13,485
And then now, right now--

812
01:15:13,561 --> 01:15:17,019
But I told you it doesn't matter.
What I want for you is to be pretty--

813
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:19,327
even prettier.

814
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,062
Yes, I know you don't like it
when I tell you that you're beautiful.

815
01:15:22,136 --> 01:15:24,798
You think I'm exaggerating.

816
01:15:24,872 --> 01:15:25,668
Wait.

817
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,373
I'll explain. Wait.

818
01:15:30,377 --> 01:15:32,311
I'm waiting.

819
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:35,041
I won't talk about your beauty anymore.

820
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:38,676
I'll even tell you you're ugly,
if you want.

821
01:15:38,752 --> 01:15:42,415
I'll try to describe you
as if you were a photograph...

822
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:43,820
or a painting.

823
01:15:43,891 --> 01:15:45,381
Be quiet.

824
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:48,424
Your face--

825
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:52,329
Your face is a landscape.

826
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,027
You see? I'm neutral
and impartial.

827
01:15:56,637 --> 01:15:58,400
There are two eyes...

828
01:15:58,472 --> 01:16:00,940
two small, brown lakes.

829
01:16:01,008 --> 01:16:03,203
Brown-green.

830
01:16:03,277 --> 01:16:06,440
Two small brownish-green lakes.

831
01:16:06,513 --> 01:16:10,506
Your forehead is a plain.

832
01:16:11,619 --> 01:16:13,211
Your nose--

833
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:16,620
a very little mountain.

834
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:20,888
Your mouth-- a volcano.

835
01:16:20,961 --> 01:16:23,191
Open it a little.
I love to see your teeth.

836
01:16:23,264 --> 01:16:24,891
No, no. Not too much.

837
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:28,597
There. Like that.

838
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:30,694
You know what comes out of your mouth
when you're bad?

839
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:31,897
Toads.

840
01:16:31,972 --> 01:16:33,940
Yes, yes. Toads.

841
01:16:34,008 --> 01:16:36,238
And pearl necklaces,
when you're nice.

842
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:40,104
Wait.

843
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,772
I am waiting.

844
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,580
Let's talk a bit
about your smile now.

845
01:16:45,653 --> 01:16:48,713
No, not that one.

846
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:51,917
That's the one you make on the street
at shopkeepers.

847
01:16:51,992 --> 01:16:54,222
No. Give me the other one,
the real one.

848
01:16:54,295 --> 01:16:57,264
The happy one.
There you go.

849
01:16:57,331 --> 01:16:59,162
That's it. Great!

850
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:03,167
No, that's too much.
It hurts my eyes.

851
01:17:03,237 --> 01:17:05,262
I don't want to look at you anymore.

852
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:06,328
Wait.

853
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:08,773
I am waiting.

854
01:17:08,842 --> 01:17:11,276
My eyes are closed,
but I still see you.

855
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:14,010
I'm visualizing.

856
01:17:15,683 --> 01:17:19,779
If I were blind, I would while my time
caressing your face.

857
01:17:19,853 --> 01:17:21,081
Your body too.

858
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:25,521
And if I were deaf...

859
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:28,652
I would learn to read your lips
with my fingers...

860
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:30,663
like that.

861
01:17:41,608 --> 01:17:43,633
Even if it all has to end badly...

862
01:17:43,711 --> 01:17:46,612
I am delighted
to have known you, Madame.

863
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:11,537
Where are you going?

864
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,300
I'm not going
the same way you are.

865
01:18:13,374 --> 01:18:14,966
You mean you're not coming
to the fitting?

866
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:16,373
I'm going to the movies.

867
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:18,035
You're going
to the movies alone?

868
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:20,637
- What are you going to see?
- Arizona Jim.

869
01:18:20,714 --> 01:18:23,376
Well, in that case, I'll see
you at home. I'll take a cab.

870
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:24,747
Okay.

871
01:18:24,818 --> 01:18:26,843
Louis, try to be good, huh?

872
01:18:41,235 --> 01:18:42,862
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

873
01:18:44,438 --> 01:18:47,430
- Monsieur MahÈ. How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

874
01:18:47,508 --> 01:18:52,036
But don't you remember me?
Comolli, the private detective.

875
01:18:52,112 --> 01:18:53,739
Yes, yes, of course.

876
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:58,183
Good. I had the impression that
you didn't really recognize me.

877
01:18:58,252 --> 01:19:01,688
It's true,
it was 12,000 kilometers away.

878
01:19:01,755 --> 01:19:03,814
Which way are you going?
This way or that way?

879
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:06,951
- Nowhere in particular.
- Oh, fine.

880
01:19:07,027 --> 01:19:10,121
Then we could spend
a few minutes together maybe.

881
01:19:10,197 --> 01:19:12,131
Shall we sit down?

882
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:15,460
I wanted to talk to you...

883
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:18,437
to bring you up to date
on my investigation.

884
01:19:18,505 --> 01:19:21,201
By the way,
what are you doing here?

885
01:19:21,275 --> 01:19:23,106
I'm on vacation.

886
01:19:24,478 --> 01:19:27,106
That's quite a coincidence.

887
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:32,380
Because I'm here working on the
investigation you hired me for.

888
01:19:32,453 --> 01:19:34,546
I'm even wondering
if your wife--

889
01:19:34,621 --> 01:19:36,885
I'm afraid
I must call her your wife--

890
01:19:36,957 --> 01:19:38,891
I'm wondering
if she's not in the vicinity.

891
01:19:38,959 --> 01:19:41,553
I'm on the trail of a blonde
who was working as a hostess...

892
01:19:41,628 --> 01:19:45,325
in a nightclub in the Antibes
and then...

893
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:47,230
she disappeared.

894
01:19:48,936 --> 01:19:53,805
I only know your wife from the
picture you gave me in Reunion.

895
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:55,808
In terms of
a police identification...

896
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:58,845
she has no
distinguishing marks at all.

897
01:19:58,912 --> 01:20:03,144
Surprisingly,
whenever I describe her...

898
01:20:03,217 --> 01:20:05,742
the symmetry of her features...

899
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:09,550
the transparency of her skin
and her hair.

900
01:20:09,623 --> 01:20:12,456
People who've met her
always remember her.

901
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:16,893
Gentlemen really
do prefer blondes.

902
01:20:18,499 --> 01:20:22,299
In any case,
she doesn't pass unnoticed.

903
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:25,736
Since you got here, you haven't
heard anything about her?

904
01:20:25,806 --> 01:20:28,001
I've been cured of blondes.

905
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:31,738
Sometimes one has a relapse,
you know.

906
01:20:31,812 --> 01:20:34,178
How about
having dinner together?

907
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:36,307
Which hotel are you staying at?

908
01:20:36,383 --> 01:20:37,680
Hotel?

909
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:41,118
Aren't you in a hotel?
Are you staying with friends?

910
01:20:42,356 --> 01:20:45,348
- Would you like something?
- A beer.

911
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:46,892
Waiter.

912
01:20:48,262 --> 01:20:50,196
Two beers.

913
01:20:50,264 --> 01:20:51,822
Excuse me.

914
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:52,589
Hurry up, Marion.
We've got to get out of here.

915
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:54,684
We've got to leave this place.

916
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:57,127
It's me, Monsieur MahÈ.

917
01:21:57,197 --> 01:21:58,721
Comolli.

918
01:21:58,799 --> 01:22:01,666
Were you expecting someone else?

919
01:22:01,735 --> 01:22:04,363
No, no. I thought it was
the maid, that's all.

920
01:22:04,438 --> 01:22:06,929
And these dresses, these shoes,
these stockings...

921
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:09,100
do they belong to your maid?

922
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:14,111
Monsieur Comolli, I don't want
you to look for my wife anymore.

923
01:22:14,181 --> 01:22:17,241
You can drop your investigation.
Just tell me how much I owe you.

924
01:22:17,317 --> 01:22:21,151
I see. You certainly have
the right to change your mind.

925
01:22:21,221 --> 01:22:24,418
But I'd like to remind you
of one thing.

926
01:22:24,491 --> 01:22:26,516
You aren't my only client
in this affair.

927
01:22:26,593 --> 01:22:28,561
There is also
Madame Berthe Roussel, remember?

928
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:31,792
She's paid half the fee and it
wouldn't be fair at all to her.

929
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:36,529
I'll take care of Berthe Roussel.
I'll write to her.

930
01:22:36,603 --> 01:22:40,596
No, no, Monsieur MahÈ.
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

931
01:22:40,674 --> 01:22:43,108
You've picked the only detective
who's incapable...

932
01:22:43,176 --> 01:22:46,839
of dropping an investigation
once he's started it.

933
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:52,647
- Excuse me, I have things to do.
- Then I'll walk along with you.

934
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,243
Behind you, if you prefer.

935
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:56,448
No, look, Monsieur Comolli,
I'm not getting through to you.

936
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:58,150
Let's forget about fees.

937
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:00,625
I'll pay what you want,
as much as you like.

938
01:23:00,694 --> 01:23:02,753
Just name a figure.

939
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:04,694
Only leave us alone.

940
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:07,495
I don't want any money.

941
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:10,229
I must arrest the person
who lives here with you.

942
01:23:10,303 --> 01:23:11,736
It no longer concerns you.

943
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,438
It's in the hands of the police.

944
01:23:15,509 --> 01:23:18,069
The body of the real
Julie Roussel...

945
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:21,273
was found
in the port of Djibouti.

946
01:23:21,348 --> 01:23:23,748
If your wife wasn't
directly responsible...

947
01:23:23,817 --> 01:23:26,684
she was an accomplice
in this murder.

948
01:23:28,055 --> 01:23:30,023
I'm not leaving here
without her.

949
01:23:31,692 --> 01:23:33,023
You're wrong, Monsieur Comolli.

950
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:35,891
My wife is not leaving
this house, and neither are you.

951
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:05,024
What are you doing there?

952
01:24:05,092 --> 01:24:08,994
I thought you hadn't come home yet.
I didn't see any lights.

953
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:11,656
You're mad because I'm late.

954
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:15,896
Here, I got you the plain cotton
socks that you like so much.

955
01:24:15,969 --> 01:24:17,561
Look.

956
01:24:22,509 --> 01:24:24,238
What happened? Who is it?

957
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:26,575
Comolli, the private detective.

958
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:29,778
- Did you do it?
- Yes.

959
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:33,786
He'd traced you here. He wanted
to turn you over to the police.

960
01:24:35,789 --> 01:24:37,848
That makes one less bastard.

961
01:24:40,861 --> 01:24:42,886
What are we going to do?

962
01:24:42,963 --> 01:24:46,330
To begin with,
let's have something to drink.

963
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:48,333
I'll go and get it.

964
01:24:55,509 --> 01:24:57,670
- We must leave.
- Yes, that's right.

965
01:24:57,744 --> 01:25:01,874
But not right away. We've got to
cover up our tracks carefully.

966
01:25:07,554 --> 01:25:10,182
First we've got to bury him.

967
01:25:10,257 --> 01:25:12,191
In the garden?

968
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:15,961
No, the cellar.

969
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:19,487
There is one,
but I've never been down there.

970
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:23,593
I'll have to go see
what kind of a floor it is...

971
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,831
whether it's cement
or just a dirt floor.

972
01:26:18,992 --> 01:26:22,359
Are you going to bed like that?

973
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:24,556
Why do you talk to me like that?

974
01:26:24,631 --> 01:26:26,565
What do you mean?

975
01:26:26,633 --> 01:26:28,567
Come here.

976
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,632
Come.

977
01:26:40,814 --> 01:26:42,748
Come here.

978
01:26:53,226 --> 01:26:56,161
No, no, not like this.

979
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:01,792
Yes, yes, yes.

980
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,234
Are you hungry too?

981
01:27:49,215 --> 01:27:51,149
I'll peel you an orange.

982
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:59,183
Our only problem is to find out
if that idiot cop--

983
01:27:59,259 --> 01:28:01,193
Comolli was not a cop.
He was a private detective.

984
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:03,923
Anyway, we've got to find out
if anyone else knew...

985
01:28:03,997 --> 01:28:06,261
about the investigation,
especially here in France.

986
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:10,133
Maybe he told someone he'd
traced us to Aix-en-Provence.

987
01:28:10,203 --> 01:28:12,398
Maybe he's the kind of man who
tells everything to his wife.

988
01:28:12,472 --> 01:28:13,962
He wasn't a married man.

989
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,201
He was the kind of person
who kept to himself.

990
01:28:16,276 --> 01:28:17,834
All wrapped up in his work.

991
01:28:17,911 --> 01:28:21,540
Let's hope nobody will notice his
disappearance for a long time to come.

992
01:28:21,614 --> 01:28:23,548
And by then
we'll be settled in Paris.

993
01:28:23,616 --> 01:28:27,450
I've already told you to forget that.
We mustn't go to Paris.

994
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,648
I think we'd better go
to some city like Lyon.

995
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:33,090
I don't understand.
Why Lyon and not Paris?

996
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:37,152
Because that's what I think is
best. Don't bother me anymore!

997
01:28:43,603 --> 01:28:46,970
You were nicer to me
when you called me Julie.

998
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,632
Was I?

999
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:51,574
You think so?

1000
01:29:57,210 --> 01:30:00,941
- What are you thinking about?
- About you.

1001
01:30:01,014 --> 01:30:02,914
Yes, but what about me?

1002
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:05,610
I'm worried. You've been
spending an awful lot of money.

1003
01:30:05,685 --> 01:30:09,553
- Here we go again.
- Yep.

1004
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:14,448
I don't understand it.
It just slips through my fingers.

1005
01:30:14,527 --> 01:30:18,088
I heard they are starting
a cigarette factory near Grenoble.

1006
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:20,291
I think I'll go and see
if I can get a job.

1007
01:30:20,366 --> 01:30:23,301
Work! I don't believe in it.

1008
01:30:23,369 --> 01:30:26,167
And besides,
I hate men who work.

1009
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:29,265
Doesn't Jardine
send you money anymore?

1010
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:33,301
He used to send the money orders
to General Delivery, Marseilles.

1011
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:36,712
I could write him and tell him
that I'm in Lyon.

1012
01:30:36,783 --> 01:30:38,978
But that wouldn't be very safe.

1013
01:30:39,052 --> 01:30:40,849
To cash money orders,
you have to be known...

1014
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,979
you have to show identification.

1015
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:47,882
It's risky, isn't it?
What do you think about it?

1016
01:30:51,598 --> 01:30:55,261
Here we go. You're sulking.
I knew it.

1017
01:30:56,202 --> 01:31:00,104
Now you're just pretending to be mad
because inside you're not really mad.

1018
01:31:00,173 --> 01:31:02,505
You put on that cold look...

1019
01:31:02,575 --> 01:31:04,566
but inside you're smiling.

1020
01:31:04,644 --> 01:31:06,874
Come on.
Show me your smile.

1021
01:31:06,946 --> 01:31:09,346
I'm fed up with all that smile crap!
It doesn't work anymore!

1022
01:31:09,415 --> 01:31:12,282
Don't speak to me.
For Christ's sake, leave me alone!

1023
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,455
All right. Okay.
That's fine with me.

1024
01:31:17,924 --> 01:31:20,950
It's not difficult to know
what you're thinking of me.

1025
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:24,427
And you're asking yourself...

1026
01:31:24,497 --> 01:31:26,590
''Why the hell am I
with this guy who's broke...

1027
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:31,501
and can't even knock over an old lady
in the street to steal her purse?''

1028
01:31:31,571 --> 01:31:33,505
You only think of yourself.

1029
01:31:33,573 --> 01:31:36,167
You're not a selfish girl.

1030
01:31:36,242 --> 01:31:38,039
You're selfishness personified.

1031
01:31:38,111 --> 01:31:40,477
You think that you're a real person,
that you're unique.

1032
01:31:40,547 --> 01:31:42,276
But you're not.

1033
01:31:42,348 --> 01:31:45,181
You're just one in
a growing multitude of girls now--

1034
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:48,618
not really bitches,
not really adventuresses or whores, no--

1035
01:31:48,688 --> 01:31:51,316
But some kind of parasite...

1036
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:53,791
who live outside normal society.

1037
01:31:55,762 --> 01:31:59,198
You're not women or girls.

1038
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:01,665
You're chicks.

1039
01:32:01,734 --> 01:32:04,601
What else you are
doesn't have an exact name.

1040
01:32:04,671 --> 01:32:08,903
Mindless, with your heads
full of garbage or air.

1041
01:32:08,975 --> 01:32:10,909
You're in love with your own bodies.

1042
01:32:10,977 --> 01:32:13,571
You're always going out in the sun,
always tanning.

1043
01:32:13,646 --> 01:32:16,843
You spend hours fixing your face.

1044
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:22,377
You can't pass by a car without looking
at your reflection in the windshield.

1045
01:32:23,623 --> 01:32:26,217
But you know where to find
most of these girls?

1046
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:28,487
In airports. Yes!

1047
01:32:28,561 --> 01:32:31,394
Everywhere planes are taking off
for faraway spots.

1048
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:35,025
Because you are beautiful girls,
and beautiful girls get fought over.

1049
01:32:35,101 --> 01:32:37,433
They're invited from
one big city to another.

1050
01:32:37,503 --> 01:32:41,030
And they go there.
They stroll around everywhere...

1051
01:32:41,107 --> 01:32:43,701
with their little purses
in hand, all made up.

1052
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,539
Now you're really mad.

1053
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,084
That makes me happy.

1054
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:56,588
Because when you're mad, your mouth
gets twisted-- it gets crooked.

1055
01:32:56,656 --> 01:33:00,922
And you turn ugly.
Really ugly.

1056
01:33:00,994 --> 01:33:02,928
So dreadfully ugly.

1057
01:33:09,702 --> 01:33:11,932
You sold the bracelet I gave you, huh?

1058
01:33:12,005 --> 01:33:15,270
Well, here are other things
to sell. Here!

1059
01:33:15,942 --> 01:33:19,275
My cuff links.

1060
01:33:19,345 --> 01:33:21,939
My watch also.
There you go!

1061
01:33:22,015 --> 01:33:23,573
Just wait. That's not all.

1062
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:25,845
I've got change.
You want the change, don't you?

1063
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,764
You were right.
It was really very good.

1064
01:34:16,836 --> 01:34:18,861
It wasn't just another Western.

1065
01:34:18,938 --> 01:34:21,998
Ah no. It was a love story,
with lots of feeling in it.

1066
01:34:22,075 --> 01:34:24,043
They're wonderful, aren't they?
Both of them.

1067
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:25,941
Great.

1068
01:34:26,012 --> 01:34:29,846
Wasn't this the street, Marion--
Julie-- where you saw that coat?

1069
01:34:29,916 --> 01:34:31,281
Yes. Somewhere around here.

1070
01:34:31,351 --> 01:34:32,784
But it doesn't matter,
I've given up that idea.

1071
01:34:32,852 --> 01:34:35,082
We can go by and take
a look anyway. Is that it?

1072
01:34:35,154 --> 01:34:37,088
Yes, it's there.

1073
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,889
No, not this window.

1074
01:34:43,529 --> 01:34:45,463
I think it's further on.

1075
01:34:45,531 --> 01:34:48,796
There. There it is.
The one with the feathers.

1076
01:34:48,868 --> 01:34:52,099
Do you like it, darling?
Do you like it?

1077
01:34:52,171 --> 01:34:54,230
Yes, it's quite a coat!

1078
01:34:54,307 --> 01:34:57,799
It's quite a coat. But actually
it's really more for Paris.

1079
01:34:57,877 --> 01:34:59,276
It may be a little far out.

1080
01:34:59,345 --> 01:35:01,813
Nothing's too far out for Paris.

1081
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:04,042
Besides, it doesn't matter.

1082
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,711
Listen, Marion.

1083
01:35:09,856 --> 01:35:12,416
I'm going to Reunion.

1084
01:35:12,492 --> 01:35:15,757
I'll be gone for five days,
or four anyway.

1085
01:35:15,828 --> 01:35:18,353
When I come back,
I'll have money.

1086
01:35:18,431 --> 01:35:20,661
I'll go see Jardine
and ask him to--

1087
01:35:20,733 --> 01:35:21,859
I'll see if he--

1088
01:35:21,934 --> 01:35:25,426
if he buys the factory from me,
my part.

1089
01:35:25,505 --> 01:35:29,703
Don't go back. They're looking
for us. You'll be arrested.

1090
01:35:29,776 --> 01:35:31,835
It doesn't matter.
I'll take my chances.

1091
01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:33,845
That's what I wanted to hear.

1092
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:03,160
It's you. You've come back.
I'm glad.

1093
01:37:03,236 --> 01:37:05,397
No, I'm just passing through.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1094
01:37:05,471 --> 01:37:07,166
- I've got to talk to you.
- Why, of course. Come on inside.

1095
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,174
No, I'd rather talk to you
out here.

1096
01:37:09,242 --> 01:37:12,541
- We can be alone in my study.
- Out here is just fine.

1097
01:37:12,612 --> 01:37:15,706
I want to know how much you
estimate the business is worth?

1098
01:37:15,781 --> 01:37:17,681
Why? Do you want to sell?

1099
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,981
That's something to look into.
We'll have to talk about it.

1100
01:37:21,053 --> 01:37:23,180
On the island there are
seven or eight men...

1101
01:37:23,256 --> 01:37:24,883
who are in a position
to buy it.

1102
01:37:24,957 --> 01:37:28,825
No, that's not what I mean.
I only want to sell it to you.

1103
01:37:28,895 --> 01:37:31,261
I want to--
I want you to buy me out.

1104
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:33,298
I'm willing to sell
at half value.

1105
01:37:33,366 --> 01:37:36,335
We've got to wind up the whole
deal by tomorrow. I need cash.

1106
01:37:36,402 --> 01:37:39,860
But this is insane. You can't
do this, for Heaven's sake.

1107
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:42,567
- Wait two or three days.
- No, listen to me. I can't.

1108
01:37:42,642 --> 01:37:45,907
As soon as I spend more than
a day somewhere, it's dangerous.

1109
01:37:45,978 --> 01:37:50,244
I'm not like other men anymore.
I've become an outcast.

1110
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:53,017
I've even committed murder.

1111
01:37:53,085 --> 01:37:55,019
You've killed her?

1112
01:37:55,087 --> 01:37:57,385
Then go and see the authorities.

1113
01:37:57,456 --> 01:38:00,357
If you explain the situation,
you'll get off.

1114
01:38:00,426 --> 01:38:02,986
Out of ten crimes of passion,
they acquit eight of them.

1115
01:38:03,062 --> 01:38:05,292
But I didn't murder her.
I killed for her.

1116
01:38:05,364 --> 01:38:08,731
To save her from the police.
You see now?

1117
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:11,599
All right, I'll do what you
want, but I think it's a shame.

1118
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:14,435
I know you must be unhappy
this way.

1119
01:38:14,507 --> 01:38:17,442
I can't say
that I'm happy with her...

1120
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:19,410
but I know that I'm unable
to live without her.

1121
01:38:19,478 --> 01:38:21,912
- If I were in your place, I'd--
- You could never be in my place.

1122
01:38:21,981 --> 01:38:24,176
This kind of thing
couldn't happen to you.

1123
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:27,378
It's not your nature,
it's mine.

1124
01:38:27,453 --> 01:38:31,549
It's happened to me, and nobody else,
and I've got to face it.

1125
01:38:31,624 --> 01:38:34,718
My dear Louis,
you're far away...

1126
01:38:34,794 --> 01:38:37,228
more than 6,000 miles...

1127
01:38:37,296 --> 01:38:40,459
and I'm taking advantage of that
to tell you that I love you.

1128
01:38:40,533 --> 01:38:43,229
''Record Your Own Voice''

1129
01:38:43,302 --> 01:38:46,271
When you're near me,
I don't dare speak to you this way.

1130
01:38:46,339 --> 01:38:50,173
You overwhelm me. It's true. Even when
you're tender, you overwhelm me.

1131
01:38:50,242 --> 01:38:53,905
So I'm afraid to tell you
silly little things.

1132
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:59,441
In Reunion, especially at first,
things were so-so between us.

1133
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:01,110
But for a while now--
I know you can feel it--

1134
01:39:01,187 --> 01:39:03,815
I can't do with you anymore.

1135
01:39:03,889 --> 01:39:08,019
Only three nights without you--
it's too much.

1136
01:39:08,094 --> 01:39:10,790
Last night I couldn't get to sleep.

1137
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:13,024
I looked for you.

1138
01:39:13,099 --> 01:39:15,465
I couldn't get to sleep
until early morning...

1139
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:18,935
and as soon as I woke up,
I thought of you.

1140
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:22,439
Even when I got dressed
I thought of you.

1141
01:39:22,508 --> 01:39:26,137
I put on my little brown blouse,
the one you like.

1142
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:28,942
Wait, wait. What was it
I still wanted to tell you?

1143
01:39:29,015 --> 01:39:32,712
I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget.
Yes, here it is.

1144
01:39:32,785 --> 01:39:35,447
I wasn't always nice to you.

1145
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:39,150
I brood, but if you notice,
it's not always about money.

1146
01:39:39,225 --> 01:39:41,785
You know, when I had
my first job...

1147
01:39:41,861 --> 01:39:44,352
my bosses were always
arguing about money.

1148
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:47,627
The manager would say:
''Watch, Marion. Watch out.

1149
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:50,032
When there's more hay in the stable,
the horses will fight.''

1150
01:39:50,102 --> 01:39:51,626
Do you understand?

1151
01:39:51,704 --> 01:39:54,639
That's why I can't stand to be poor.

1152
01:39:54,707 --> 01:39:56,470
Because poverty is mediocrity.

1153
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:58,407
And that I can't take.

1154
01:39:59,879 --> 01:40:03,042
I hope that Jardine will buy back
all the shares in the factory...

1155
01:40:03,115 --> 01:40:06,050
and then we can be happy together.

1156
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,813
I think the space on the record
is almost up.

1157
01:40:09,889 --> 01:40:13,655
I'm going to end now, and I'll have you
listen to it as soon as you get back.

1158
01:40:13,726 --> 01:40:17,162
Good-bye, Louis.
I love you.

1159
01:41:05,211 --> 01:41:07,941
- Yes?
- lt's me. Were you sleeping?

1160
01:41:08,013 --> 01:41:09,503
No, I'm still awake.

1161
01:41:09,582 --> 01:41:12,073
But I thought
you were coming tomorrow.

1162
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:14,278
l was able to get
an earlier plane.

1163
01:41:14,353 --> 01:41:17,550
- Did everything go all right?
- Yes. Everything went fine.

1164
01:41:17,623 --> 01:41:19,557
Come up quickly.

1165
01:42:34,333 --> 01:42:36,267
Are you sleeping?

1166
01:43:33,192 --> 01:43:35,752
Yes, yes, yes.

1167
01:43:57,116 --> 01:43:59,584
We can have a ball in Paris
with all this.

1168
01:43:59,652 --> 01:44:02,678
For the time being, there's
no question of going to Paris.

1169
01:44:02,755 --> 01:44:04,518
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1170
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:08,026
I'm straightening it, and
smoothing it, and arranging it.

1171
01:44:08,093 --> 01:44:10,152
You really love it, don't you?

1172
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:12,561
It's not that I love it,
but I respect it.

1173
01:44:12,631 --> 01:44:15,099
You can have whatever you want
with money.

1174
01:44:15,167 --> 01:44:17,567
You can have consideration...

1175
01:44:17,636 --> 01:44:20,434
and if you get in trouble,
you can afford a good lawyer.

1176
01:44:20,506 --> 01:44:22,906
And money can even help you
get the Legion of Honor.

1177
01:44:22,975 --> 01:44:24,909
You want
the Legion of Honor now?

1178
01:44:24,977 --> 01:44:26,706
Yes, I'm serious.

1179
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:28,747
If you're in prison and you've
got the Legion of Honor...

1180
01:44:28,814 --> 01:44:31,874
you can have your own guard
standing outside your cell.

1181
01:44:31,951 --> 01:44:33,782
Where did you hear that?

1182
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:36,787
It's true, I swear. I know.

1183
01:44:36,855 --> 01:44:38,914
Let's see how much
you're taking.

1184
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:41,858
You sure that'll be enough?
Better take some more.

1185
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:53,997
We shouldn't leave the bag out.

1186
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:11,284
Yes, that's fine.

1187
01:45:11,357 --> 01:45:13,518
Do you think
the maid looks honest?

1188
01:45:13,592 --> 01:45:15,685
You see evil everywhere.

1189
01:45:15,761 --> 01:45:18,252
I don't see evil everywhere.
It is everywhere.

1190
01:45:24,403 --> 01:45:27,304
Just look how beautiful
my coat is.

1191
01:45:27,373 --> 01:45:29,307
It gets bored all alone.
It's sad.

1192
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:31,468
I should have kept it by me.

1193
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,876
It seems to me that you're
looking at a lot of girls.

1194
01:45:36,949 --> 01:45:39,213
Me? Oh no, no, I'm not.

1195
01:45:39,284 --> 01:45:41,616
Yes, Monsieur MahÈ.
You've taken to looking at women...

1196
01:45:41,687 --> 01:45:44,247
and you look at them well.

1197
01:45:44,323 --> 01:45:47,759
- Two coffees, waiter.
- And make them strong.

1198
01:45:47,826 --> 01:45:51,387
- How strong?
- As strong as your arm.

1199
01:45:51,463 --> 01:45:52,589
Really?

1200
01:45:52,664 --> 01:45:55,565
France-Soir.
Get your France-Soir.

1201
01:45:55,634 --> 01:45:58,034
Do you see what I see?

1202
01:45:58,103 --> 01:46:00,264
I'll be damned.
Here, please.

1203
01:46:03,342 --> 01:46:04,866
Thanks.

1204
01:46:04,943 --> 01:46:07,104
What does it say?

1205
01:46:07,179 --> 01:46:09,477
It took a flood last night
in Aix-en-Provence...

1206
01:46:09,548 --> 01:46:12,642
to uncover the body
of an unknown man in a cellar.

1207
01:46:12,718 --> 01:46:14,447
Continued on page five.

1208
01:46:20,592 --> 01:46:23,493
It took a flood.

1209
01:46:23,562 --> 01:46:26,554
The autopsy revealed
a bullet from a revolver...

1210
01:46:26,632 --> 01:46:28,566
in the body of the victim...

1211
01:46:28,634 --> 01:46:31,831
which would seem to justify the
theory of some criminal action.

1212
01:46:31,904 --> 01:46:34,771
The police are looking
for all the former tenants.

1213
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,535
Let's get out of here.

1214
01:46:39,945 --> 01:46:42,072
We've got to leave
as if nothing happened.

1215
01:46:42,147 --> 01:46:45,742
- Never mind those coffees. The check.
- I'm going to pick up my coat.

1216
01:46:45,818 --> 01:46:47,752
I'll leave the place first
and wait in the car.

1217
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:50,345
- Look. Be careful.
- Don't worry.

1218
01:46:59,064 --> 01:47:01,055
They're for us all right.
Let's get out of here.

1219
01:47:01,133 --> 01:47:03,226
You're out of your mind. What
about all the money up there?

1220
01:47:03,302 --> 01:47:05,770
- Forget it!
- No. I'll try to go alone.

1221
01:47:05,838 --> 01:47:07,567
They're less suspicious
of a woman.

1222
01:47:07,639 --> 01:47:11,040
No, no, listen, I have an idea.
Let's try the back.

1223
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:40,167
Marion, come back here!

1224
01:47:44,843 --> 01:47:47,403
What's the matter?

1225
01:47:47,479 --> 01:47:50,846
You can't go like that.
They'll pick you up right away.

1226
01:47:50,916 --> 01:47:53,146
Are you out of your mind?
What's wrong with this coat?

1227
01:47:53,218 --> 01:47:56,779
I know what I'm talking about.
Wait. I'll turn the car around.

1228
01:47:58,357 --> 01:48:01,292
If there's any problem,
we can get out fast.

1229
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,994
You'll make it.

1230
01:48:43,268 --> 01:48:45,634
It's for us all right. The
stairs are crawling with cops.

1231
01:48:45,704 --> 01:48:48,104
-And the money?
-You can forget about the money.

1232
01:48:48,173 --> 01:48:51,199
It's impossible to get into
our apartment. They're inside.

1233
01:48:51,276 --> 01:48:54,302
I hid in that little apartment
they're repainting.

1234
01:48:54,379 --> 01:48:56,108
I couldn't get any further.

1235
01:49:01,553 --> 01:49:03,111
Act naturally.

1236
01:49:08,227 --> 01:49:09,819
Let's get out of Lyon
and head for Switzerland.

1237
01:49:09,895 --> 01:49:11,362
And how? With no money?

1238
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,489
We're better off
without the money, and free.

1239
01:49:13,565 --> 01:49:16,125
I told you to take more!
I told you!

1240
01:49:19,238 --> 01:49:22,366
- I was sure this would happen.
- Yeah, yeah, sure. As usual.

1241
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:25,205
I'm not always sure,
but I was sure of that.

1242
01:49:26,345 --> 01:49:27,972
I told you to take more money.

1243
01:49:28,046 --> 01:49:30,105
In fact, we should never
have left that bag.

1244
01:49:30,182 --> 01:49:33,811
It's easy to say afterwards
what should've been done.

1245
01:49:37,556 --> 01:49:40,286
When Richard drove, he used
to yell at the other drivers.

1246
01:49:40,359 --> 01:49:42,452
He'd say those that passed him
were bastards...

1247
01:49:42,527 --> 01:49:45,018
and those that he passed
were suckers.

1248
01:49:45,097 --> 01:49:50,091
He would say, ''I'd rather be thought
a bastard then taken for a fool.''

1249
01:49:50,168 --> 01:49:52,636
I think that's pretty disgusting.

1250
01:49:52,704 --> 01:49:56,367
I'd prefer to be taken
for a fool than for a bastard.

1251
01:49:56,441 --> 01:49:59,933
But Richard would've never left
the money in that apartment.

1252
01:50:00,012 --> 01:50:02,037
Well, baby, you listen.

1253
01:50:02,114 --> 01:50:04,048
You know the prison
where he's locked up.

1254
01:50:04,116 --> 01:50:06,243
There's always a miserable hotel
opposite every prison.

1255
01:50:06,318 --> 01:50:10,049
Take a room on the top floor and
you can wave from your window.

1256
01:50:10,122 --> 01:50:12,215
You can bring him oranges
on Sunday and in five years...

1257
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:15,783
you'll be right there when he comes out.
Beat it. Go on.

1258
01:50:29,074 --> 01:50:31,634
Get back in the car.

1259
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:33,644
Come on.

1260
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,874
Look. Over there.

1261
01:50:42,577 --> 01:50:44,408
Do you think
anybody lives there?

1262
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:46,413
Surely not.
There would be smoke.

1263
01:50:46,481 --> 01:50:50,542
It must be a lodge for skiers
or something like that.

1264
01:50:52,053 --> 01:50:53,816
It's wonderful.

1265
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:56,220
I'd never expect
to find this here.

1266
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:59,124
It's a series that's impossible
to find anymore.

1267
01:50:59,194 --> 01:51:01,059
And besides being rare...

1268
01:51:01,129 --> 01:51:03,723
it's the first book that
my grandfather ever gave me.

1269
01:51:04,966 --> 01:51:08,129
I'll read parts of it to you
every night.

1270
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:11,104
I prefer this old cookbook.
It's more fun.

1271
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:16,169
- Did you look at the map?
- I sure did.

1272
01:51:16,244 --> 01:51:19,111
In order to get across
this border here...

1273
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,011
we should be able
to go through this forest.

1274
01:51:21,082 --> 01:51:24,540
It's almost unwatched,
especially during the weekend.

1275
01:51:24,619 --> 01:51:26,143
We can make it across
this weekend...

1276
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:29,918
and once we're on the other side,
we'll be out of trouble.

1277
01:51:29,991 --> 01:51:31,652
What about cash?

1278
01:51:31,726 --> 01:51:34,024
You're not going
to begin that again.

1279
01:51:34,095 --> 01:51:36,689
We've still got a little bit,
then we can sell the car.

1280
01:51:36,764 --> 01:51:39,255
Yes, but that's just
small change.

1281
01:51:40,468 --> 01:51:43,562
I've got an idea,
but you'll just get mad.

1282
01:51:43,638 --> 01:51:45,799
Of course I won't. Tell me.

1283
01:51:45,874 --> 01:51:49,173
Jardine made a pretty good deal
when he bought your shares.

1284
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:52,475
If you explained things,
he'd be glad to help you.

1285
01:51:52,547 --> 01:51:54,845
Oh no, the last time I went
was bad enough.

1286
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:58,477
I could never bring myself
to face him again.

1287
01:51:58,553 --> 01:52:01,886
- If I went in your place?
- You're out of your mind!

1288
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:05,486
That man hates you.

1289
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,959
What?

1290
01:52:07,028 --> 01:52:09,053
Well, it's normal.

1291
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:12,998
Put yourself in his place.
It's unimportant anyway.

1292
01:52:13,067 --> 01:52:14,932
He hates me,
your Monsieur Jardine.

1293
01:52:15,003 --> 01:52:16,470
I must say he's got some nerve.

1294
01:52:16,537 --> 01:52:19,404
I didn't look for you.
I didn't kill the detective.

1295
01:52:19,474 --> 01:52:22,238
He hates me, does he?
Well, that's pretty good.

1296
01:52:25,413 --> 01:52:27,677
Come back. Listen.

1297
01:52:27,749 --> 01:52:29,307
You listen.
We'll never make it together.

1298
01:52:29,384 --> 01:52:32,217
Give me the keys to the car
and I'll manage.

1299
01:52:39,027 --> 01:52:41,757
I am still your husband.
You won't be going anywhere.

1300
01:52:41,829 --> 01:52:45,629
- And who'll stop me, you?
- Yes.

1301
01:53:26,407 --> 01:53:29,740
A rat. I saw a rat over there,
by the door. I couldn't sleep.

1302
01:53:29,811 --> 01:53:32,905
I'll see about it
in the morning. Come to bed.

1303
01:53:50,131 --> 01:53:53,464
The man said to spread it
around every two or three days.

1304
01:53:53,534 --> 01:53:57,231
In three days I hope
we won't be here.

1305
01:53:57,305 --> 01:53:59,296
- The broth?
- Coming up.

1306
01:54:12,787 --> 01:54:14,846
Did you read
the back of the box?

1307
01:54:14,922 --> 01:54:16,787
You'd better wash your hands.

1308
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:38,474
- What time is it?
- The sun's up already.

1309
01:54:38,546 --> 01:54:42,107
I threw up last night
for the first time in my life.

1310
01:54:42,183 --> 01:54:45,016
I've been sick as a dog.

1311
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:47,213
I vomited all over.

1312
01:54:47,288 --> 01:54:48,949
Did it disgust you?

1313
01:54:49,023 --> 01:54:51,787
No, nothing disgusts me.

1314
01:54:55,997 --> 01:54:57,760
Don't you think it would be best
if a doctor came out?

1315
01:54:57,832 --> 01:55:00,357
Have a doctor come here?
It's not safe.

1316
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:02,369
I'd rather go into the village.
It's not far.

1317
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:05,031
I'll ask the pharmacist
what to do.

1318
01:55:05,106 --> 01:55:07,802
He should know.

1319
01:55:07,875 --> 01:55:10,639
Here, drink this before I go.

1320
01:55:15,316 --> 01:55:17,784
You want anything else?

1321
01:55:17,852 --> 01:55:19,911
Give me my book.

1322
01:55:25,226 --> 01:55:27,387
No, the-- the second volume.

1323
01:55:32,433 --> 01:55:34,663
I won't be long.

1324
01:56:27,755 --> 01:56:32,988
''Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs''

1325
01:58:42,189 --> 01:58:45,124
Thank you. That's him all right.
That's my husband.

1326
01:58:50,264 --> 01:58:52,755
Louis, darling,
what are you doing out here?

1327
01:58:52,833 --> 01:58:55,324
You shouldn't be out
in the cold.

1328
01:58:55,403 --> 01:58:56,563
When I didn't see you at home...

1329
01:58:56,637 --> 01:58:59,197
I knew you were doing
something foolish.

1330
01:59:00,141 --> 01:59:02,234
Come on. I'll take you home.

1331
01:59:03,878 --> 01:59:05,812
I'm the only one
who can take care of you.

1332
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,747
Yes, take me back. I'm tired.

1333
01:59:13,187 --> 01:59:16,281
Drink that, my darling.
You'll feel better.

1334
01:59:18,125 --> 01:59:20,252
You'd better fill it
all the way.

1335
01:59:20,328 --> 01:59:22,853
I know what you're up to.

1336
01:59:22,930 --> 01:59:24,955
I accept it.

1337
01:59:25,032 --> 01:59:27,626
And I am not sorry
to have known you.

1338
01:59:27,702 --> 01:59:31,160
I am not sorry to have killed
a man for you.

1339
01:59:31,238 --> 01:59:33,331
I am not sorry I love you.

1340
01:59:33,407 --> 01:59:38,709
I'm not sorry for anything, except
there's this terrible pain. It's awful.

1341
01:59:38,779 --> 01:59:42,613
It's burning inside.
So let's get it over with.

1342
01:59:42,683 --> 01:59:46,016
Quickly!
Fill it up!

1343
01:59:46,087 --> 01:59:49,750
You knew and you did
nothing about it!

1344
01:59:49,824 --> 01:59:52,452
I'm ashamed! I'm ashamed!

1345
01:59:54,362 --> 01:59:55,624
I'm ashamed!

1346
01:59:57,598 --> 02:00:01,591
No woman deserves to be loved
like this. I'm not worth it.

1347
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:05,469
But it's not too late. I'll take
care of you. You're going to live.

1348
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:08,337
We'll go far away
from here together.

1349
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:10,969
I'm strong enough
for both of us. You'll live.

1350
02:00:11,045 --> 02:00:15,106
Do you hear me?
You're going to live!

1351
02:00:15,182 --> 02:00:17,878
Nobody can take you away
from me.

1352
02:00:26,227 --> 02:00:28,161
I love you, Louis.

1353
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:30,288
I love you.

1354
02:00:30,364 --> 02:00:34,425
Maybe you don't believe me,
but lots of incredible things are true.

1355
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:37,904
You must be strong, my love.

1356
02:00:37,972 --> 02:00:41,237
We'll go far from here,
and we'll be together...

1357
02:00:41,308 --> 02:00:43,401
if you still want me.

1358
02:00:45,146 --> 02:00:47,205
But you are all I want.

1359
02:00:47,281 --> 02:00:49,249
Only you.

1360
02:00:49,316 --> 02:00:52,615
Just as you are,
absolutely.

1361
02:00:52,686 --> 02:00:54,620
You mustn't cry, my dear.

1362
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:58,381
It's your happiness I want,
not your tears.

1363
02:01:03,164 --> 02:01:06,759
I'm learning
what love is, Louis.

1364
02:01:06,834 --> 02:01:09,394
It's painful.

1365
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:11,404
It hurts me.

1366
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:15,537
Is that what love is?

1367
02:01:15,609 --> 02:01:18,601
Is it always so painful?

1368
02:01:18,679 --> 02:01:20,909
Yes, it hurts.

1369
02:01:59,787 --> 02:02:01,755
I think it's that way.

1370
02:02:01,822 --> 02:02:03,790
No, I'm sure it's that way.

1371
02:02:08,462 --> 02:02:11,158
It was kind of nice,
that little cabin.

1372
02:02:12,233 --> 02:02:14,360
You are beautiful.

1373
02:02:14,435 --> 02:02:17,370
When I look at you, it hurts.

1374
02:02:17,438 --> 02:02:21,534
Really? Yesterday you said
it was a joy.

1375
02:02:21,609 --> 02:02:24,976
It is a joy and yet it hurts.

1376
02:02:25,045 --> 02:02:26,979
I love you.

1377
02:02:28,482 --> 02:02:30,416
I believe you, Julie.

1
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,632
THE LAST METRO

2
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,974
<i>Paris, September 1942.</i>

3
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,940
<i>Half of France is occupied
by the Germans.</i>

4
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:34,362
<i>The Occupied and Free zones...</i>

5
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:37,530
<i>are officially divided
by a borderline.</i>

6
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,538
<i>In Paris, the curfew...</i>

7
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,457
<i>is imposed at 11 p. m.</i>

8
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:44,671
<i>No one can afford to miss
the last metro.</i>

9
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:49,135
<i>Hungry Parisians queue up
to buy food...</i>

10
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,672
<i>and flock to theatres for warmth.</i>

11
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,141
<i>Movies are just as crowded...</i>

12
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,145
<i>playing to full houses.</i>

13
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:00,683
<i>At the Montmartre Theatre,
rehearsals are under way...</i>

14
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:04,607
<i>though its director,
Lucas Steiner, has fled France:</i>

15
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,663
<i>He didn´t have much choice!</i>

16
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:14,163
Excuse me, Mlle.
I noticed you... I wonder...

17
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,044
What time it is? It´s 6:40.

18
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,672
No, I´ve got a watch.

19
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,381
What else? Are you lost?

20
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,306
No, I live around here.

21
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,798
In that case... so long!

22
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:27,149
Wait... I don´t want you
to think I´m on the make...

23
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,058
I mean it.

24
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,189
Why would I think that?

25
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,409
I was in the café...
making a call...

26
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:38,121
I noticed you...
I mean it was your eyes...

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,044
and your expression.

28
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,169
So I figured...

29
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:46,334
What?

30
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:49,343
Well, this is my lucky day,
so I thought...

31
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,968
we might have a drink and talk.

32
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,058
I´m not thirsty and not interested.
Let me be!

33
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:59,738
You´ve got me all wrong.
D´you think I do this every day?

34
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,405
No, only every other day!

35
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,072
Stop pestering me.

36
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:10,668
Okay, have it your way...
No, wait... let me explain:

37
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:14,963
do you know what it means
to be attracted to someone?

38
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,341
Please, believe me...

39
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,770
I haven´t accosted
a strange woman in... 4 years.

40
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,391
What an honor...

41
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:27,815
Look, that´s enough!

42
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:29,987
D´you want a public scandal?

43
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,864
Think about it.
Let me have something: a name...

44
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,537
an address, a phone number.
I´m Bernard.

45
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,542
You want my number?

46
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,751
Great! Let me write it down.

47
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,802
Odeon 84-00.

48
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,515
Odeon 84-00...
Hey, who´re you kidding?

49
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,558
That´s the Talking Clock number!

50
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,161
Who´s that boy?

51
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:03,831
He´s the concierge´s son.

52
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:06,247
She works at the theatre.

53
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,222
What did he do to you?

54
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:21,145
He patted my head.

55
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,896
Let´s go and wash your hair out!

56
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:26,645
Come back here at once!

57
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:35,751
Is the theatre closed?

58
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,622
No. Go in through the stage door.

59
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,815
I´ve got an appointment.

60
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:51,941
Mr Granger?

61
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:52,818
Yes.

62
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,115
Mrs Steiner is expecting you.
Follow me.

63
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,087
Beautiful theatre!

64
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,500
It beats the Grand Guignol, right?

65
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,595
It´s twice as big...

66
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,466
I´ve been here before...

67
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,390
I saw Mrs Steiner
in "The Cherry Orchard".

68
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:18,473
Any news of Lucas Steiner?

69
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:21,148
The boss? He was lucky...

70
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,441
One day,
they came looking for him...

71
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,237
Here? The Germans?

72
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:28,656
No, the French.
They were buzzing all around...

73
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,414
but he had already
skipped out of Paris.

74
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,663
I hear he´s in America...

75
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:35,458
South America...

76
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:39,093
or around there.
I hope he can work.

77
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:44,429
The offices are upstairs.

78
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:46,644
Bernard Granger... Mr Merlin.

79
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,221
I recognized you.

80
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:53,775
Merlin´s our business manager.
He handles the finances.

81
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,498
Wait here.

82
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,033
A few minutes.

83
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,367
Okay, thanks.

84
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:21,692
Marion, I know Rosen´s
Aryan Certificate is a fake...

85
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:25,868
but they won´t check it
with a magnifying glass.

86
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,623
He´s got no work permit.

87
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,242
He´ll claim he lost it.

88
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,539
We could use our contacts.

89
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,466
No, we may need them.

90
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,379
With the papers he´s got,
he manages to work...

91
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,760
at the film studios.

92
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,643
He´s lucky they´re so careless...

93
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:47,891
but here, we stick to the rules:
no permit, no work!

94
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,573
What can I tell Rosen?

95
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,953
The truth: no Jews
in Marion Steiner´s theatre!

96
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:00,250
Rosen, come this way...

97
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:08,347
I didn´t know you were here!
I´ll be right back.

98
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,970
I´ll go get Marion.

99
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:15,273
Did you explain my case
to Mrs Steiner?

100
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,229
What did she say?

101
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,317
Sorry Rosen,
she won´t hire a Jew...

102
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,194
I just can´t believe it.

103
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:26,079
Anywhere else, I´d expect this...

104
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,295
but in Lucas Steiner´s
own theatre...

105
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,416
it´s truly an outrage!

106
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:40,308
Come in.

107
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,598
Hold it! I want to understand.

108
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,564
What?

109
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:49,483
I considered myself lucky to play
here but if I must lower my pants...

110
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:53,155
to prove I´m not a Jew...
thanks, but no thanks!

111
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,457
Besides, I refuse to take
anyone´s job away from him.

112
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,247
You´ve got it all wrong...

113
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,135
That actor was not slated
for the role of the tutor...

114
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:08,220
but for a walk-on in the third act.

115
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,181
Believe me!

116
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,773
Believe me, Granger...

117
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:16,486
You were my first choice
as Marion´s leading man.

118
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,859
You must realize our position...

119
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,321
We need an okay for the play.

120
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,496
We´re still waiting
for the Censor´s visa.

121
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:28,003
This is Bernard Granger.

122
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:31,251
I´ve heard great things about you...

123
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:35,006
from friends who saw you
at the Grand Guignol.

124
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,761
And I trust Jean-Loup.

125
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:41,315
At first, l was doubtful
about the Grand Guignol...

126
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:44,564
but finally, I enjoyed
playing "The Skeleton".

127
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:47,356
I never saw it
because I work at night.

128
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:49,235
In the past...

129
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,696
my husband managed everything.

130
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,701
I knew nothing
about administration...

131
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,379
and business details.

132
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,009
I had to learn quickly.

133
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,005
Let´s discuss your contract.

134
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,177
Right now?

135
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:06,267
Let´s get it over with.

136
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,687
What did you earn
at Grand Guignol?

137
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,725
I was looking for you.

138
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:16,360
Here´s the script. It´s wholesome
reading. Memorize it, child!

139
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,364
This one?

140
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:19,576
Yes, thanks.

141
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:22,828
I couldn´t find it
at the theatre bookshop.

142
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,121
It hasn´t been published.

143
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,250
I´ve never heard of it.

144
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,719
It´s a Norwegian play,
by a Norwegian playwright...

145
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:33,767
Karen Bergen,
a genuinely Norwegian name.

146
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,683
Lucas discovered it
and had it translated.

147
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:38,392
Do you speak Norwegian?

148
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:42,775
Neither do I. But I bet the critics
will pan the translation!

149
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,244
D´you know Granger?

150
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,320
Is he here?

151
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:49,822
In my office.

152
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,584
I don´t know him...

153
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,250
but we almost met.

154
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,293
Hello!

155
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,795
We expected you at Lucien´s
house-warming party.

156
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:02,632
I couldn´t make it.
We´ll meet again.

157
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:07,100
<i>"I hereby declare
I am not Jewish...</i>

158
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,309
<i>and to the best
of my knowledge...</i>

159
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,447
<i>my parents or grandparents
are not Jewish."</i>

160
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:20,913
How did it go?

161
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,791
Okay!

162
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,666
Great. I´ll see you around.

163
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,835
You never really wanted
to be an actress.

164
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:30,723
I enjoyed the job I had.

165
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:34,103
I know.
If Lucas hadn´t kidnapped you...

166
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:36,805
you´d still be in fashion.

167
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,520
Right, and that´s not all:

168
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:44,117
he said that if I refused,
he´d ask Coco Chanel to fire me!

169
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,204
It sounds just like him.

170
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,289
Can I turn the lights off?

171
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,200
Yes.

172
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,053
I´m waiting for you.

173
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,514
Right.

174
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,354
Oh hell! Daxiat!

175
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,640
I forgot we had a dinner date.

176
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:07,402
I´ll see you later.

177
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:08,858
Goodnight.

178
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,863
Don´t let him see you...

179
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,949
I forgot to tell you...

180
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,570
that I´m having dinner
with Daxiat.

181
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:18,910
He can help us
get the Censor´s visa...

182
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,704
I sort of promised
you might come.

183
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,121
You shouldn´t have.

184
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:26,048
I don´t see how
you can associate with him.

185
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:27,925
I don´t have much choice.

186
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,348
Remember why he panned
"Britannicus"?

187
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,397
Yes, he claimed it was
an effeminate play.

188
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:37,935
Even so, we need his help
for the visa...

189
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:41,075
All I ask is for you to say hello...

190
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,576
and also shake his hand.

191
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,579
I´ll shake his hand...

192
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,915
but no dinner. Figure out
some excuse. I´m going home.

193
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,550
Raymond, cut the lights.

194
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,642
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."

195
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,726
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."

196
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,054
Eric hesitates...

197
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,277
then turns back to his mother.

198
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,648
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"

199
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,741
"l don´t know.
What do you think?"

200
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:41,443
"He will return."

201
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:43,289
As Helena´s embroidery...

202
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,864
drops from her hands...

203
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,335
Carl hears a sound
and turns around.

204
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:49,379
"Who´s there?"

205
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:50,790
He sees Helena.

206
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:52,375
"Why are you hiding?"

207
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,467
"Leave this house.
Your presence here is harmful."

208
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,175
"Before I go,
you must hear me out."

209
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,897
"When Dr Sanders
hired me last Spring..."

210
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,356
Wait... let´s reverse that...

211
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,778
I think it´s best
to start with "Last Spring..."

212
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,364
"You must hear me out."

213
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:12,744
Hello, darling.

214
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,499
"Last Spring,
when Dr Sanders hired me..."

215
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:17,588
Come over here.

216
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,419
Arlette Guillaume,
our set and costume designer.

217
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,677
Bernard Granger...
he´ll play Carl.

218
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,554
You must have seen his act.

219
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:27,886
I don´t think so...

220
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,691
Wait... yes, I have seen it.

221
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:33,021
At the Grand Guignol?

222
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:37,821
No, in a very banal role:
Just a man...

223
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,199
on the prowl.

224
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,080
You can´t judge me by that part...

225
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,706
I was improvising.

226
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:47,163
You seemed to know it by heart!

227
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:49,341
The rehearsal´s over...

228
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,214
but I want to say something.

229
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:54,305
I´m going to stage the play.

230
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,094
Like all of you,
I´d have preferred...

231
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,933
that "Disappearance"
be directed by Lucas himself.

232
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:04,523
Fortunately,
he left us explicit notes...

233
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:06,902
as to the staging.

234
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:09,695
It goes without saying that...

235
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,909
we´ll be guided by his notes.

236
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:16,085
I´ll do my best to help you all.

237
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,218
That´s it!

238
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,341
May I leave now?

239
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:21,802
Run along.

240
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:26,767
What about Daxiat,
the drama critic?

241
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,439
Can´t he help us...

242
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:33,403
He got us the Censor´s visa,
so let´s not make waves.

243
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,073
Can you help me fix my bracelet?

244
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,493
The clasp is stuck.

245
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:42,409
You read palms?

246
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:46,421
What do you see?

247
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,505
There are two women in you.

248
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,682
That´s true. Go on!

249
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:57,523
Raymond, come quickly!
I´m scared...

250
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:00,060
I hear noises in the theatre.

251
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:03,440
Don´t worry, Germaine.
I´ll take a look.

252
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:05,983
Anybody here?

253
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:12,337
Anybody here?

254
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,302
How did you get in?

255
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,640
I watched the rehearsal.
It looks great.

256
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,813
I told you to wait outside, Martine!

257
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:27,141
Calm down.

258
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,903
Look what I´ve got.

259
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:30,864
Still interested?

260
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:33,697
I had no money.
I´ve got to pay for it tonight.

261
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:34,576
How much?

262
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,575
4 200 francs.

263
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:37,988
It´s 14 lbs!

264
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:39,751
I´ll go ask Mrs Steiner.

265
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:42,917
The Grand Guignol
has 100 orchestra seats...

266
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:46,254
200 with the balcony.
You average half a house?

267
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,352
Just about.
A little more on Sundays...

268
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,809
but they average half a house.

269
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:59,521
The seats range
from 20 to 40 francs...

270
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:02,198
A daily gross of 6 000.
How many players?

271
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,277
Mrs Steiner?

272
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:04,362
Excuse me.

273
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:06,697
The ham?

274
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,164
Oh, yes.

275
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,002
How many?

276
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,502
Four actors.
Tree of us play two roles each.

277
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,802
With the costs,
they barely break even.

278
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,341
It´s a losing proposition.

279
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,303
I´m ready. Shall we go?

280
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:33,862
Goodnight, Mrs Steiner.

281
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,159
Goodnight, Marion.

282
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,153
Come in.

283
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:02,657
I´ve got your ham. It´s 4 200 frs.

284
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:03,952
4 200 frs?

285
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:07,668
If it´s too expensive,
I can give it back.

286
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,800
No. It´ll last me the whole winter.

287
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,761
4 200?

288
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:18,644
Right!

289
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,193
Thanks. Here´s the cello.

290
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,237
What do I want with a cello?

291
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,212
Here´s the animal.

292
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:39,462
Look...

293
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,672
14 pounds!

294
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,687
You can´t walk around
with a ham in your arms, can you?

295
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,520
No, I can´t.
Good thinking! Thanks.

296
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:54,524
I´m off. Don´t forget
the lights and shutters.

297
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:57,610
The air-raid warden
is a real bastard!

298
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,703
I´ll remember.

299
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:48,351
Sir?

300
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:50,017
Valentin.

301
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,156
Oh, forgive me.
I´m so absent-minded these days.

302
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,987
No, please don´t apologize...

303
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:58,279
I know I´ve aged a lot.

304
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:01,999
I left a script
at the desk for you...

305
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,873
a screenplay.

306
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:06,629
Read it and tell me what you think.

307
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,252
I won´t detain you.
Goodbye Marion.

308
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,428
This is for you.

309
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:17,598
I know.

310
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,642
Your keys?

311
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,442
D´you have a minute?

312
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:35,757
I keep on getting mail
for Mr Steiner...

313
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:39,304
Probably from people
who don´t know he´s gone.

314
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,512
It´s embarrassing.

315
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,224
Should I return it to the senders,
or give it to you?

316
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:48,313
It´s probably theatre business mail.

317
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:50,321
I´ll take it.

318
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:52,524
D´you want all his mail?

319
00:21:52,826 --> 00:21:53,942
- Yes.
- Fine.

320
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,824
- Thanks.
- You´re most welcome.

321
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:08,754
Room service?

322
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:11,098
No, I ate at the theatre.

323
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,107
Did the reporter
from "Paris Echos" call you ?

324
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:20,604
No. Why?

325
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,995
This morning, he was in the hallway
with a camera.

326
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,410
I told him you weren´t in.
He said:

327
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:31,463
"I just want to take
a picture of her room."

328
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:35,804
He said it was for a reportage
on "The Stars at Home".

329
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,681
I told him to call you.
Didn´t he call?

330
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:41,092
No.

331
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:42,808
Was I wrong?

332
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:46,358
No, you were right.
I hate those snoopers.

333
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,242
Are you watering your flowers?

334
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:23,702
It´s not flowers.

335
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:24,746
Vegetables?

336
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:25,992
No.

337
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:27,576
It´s for a pipe...

338
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:30,121
with a match, it smokes.

339
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,134
You´ll wind up in jail!

340
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,723
Where the hell is she?

341
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,489
For Christ´s sake!

342
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,125
Do we rehearse, or not?

343
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:58,962
We´re waiting for Nadine.
I´ll give her an earful!

344
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,272
You know what time it is?

345
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:13,022
You joy-ride with the Boches
and I get hell!

346
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,857
I was dubbing. We worked late,
so they drove me here.

347
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,411
You´re not squeamish! I bet
you´d accept a role in "Jew Süss"!

348
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:23,245
And how! But they didn´t have
a role for me!

349
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,250
Excuse me. I´m sorry.

350
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,677
Take your time!
You´re only an hour late.

351
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:35,549
What´s your excuse today?
Your alarm clock?

352
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:37,229
No, I was dubbing.

353
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:39,064
Must you grab every offer?

354
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:42,562
Can´t you leave the dubbing jobs
to those who need work?

355
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:43,776
She needs it.

356
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:45,271
She´s a pain in the ass!

357
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:46,191
No, I can´t...

358
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,028
I take every offer I get.

359
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,332
I do radio in the morning
and dubbing at noon.

360
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,335
At night, I do walk-ons.

361
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:57,335
On Thursday, I play Moliére
for school kids...

362
00:24:57,633 --> 00:25:00,125
and if it´s a bit part
in a movie, I say yes!

363
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,966
The only way to succeed
is to accept everything...

364
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:07,896
to get maximum exposure
and make new contacts.

365
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,228
If you want to fire me, say so...

366
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,780
Sacha Guitry is casting.
I can run right over.

367
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,711
Have you anyone in mind?

368
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,682
Yes, I´ve got two men:

369
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:34,347
Raoul Coquet and Fernand Coustal.
Remember them?

370
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,305
Coquet sounds good.
I´ll call him.

371
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:40,901
I´m not so sure of Coustal.

372
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,939
I´ll put a question mark
on his name.

373
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:49,781
Is that her?

374
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:51,704
Yes...

375
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:52,835
That´s her.

376
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,045
Still a beauty!

377
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:54,957
Why "still"?

378
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,466
"The Sin" dates back
to my Communion.

379
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,258
You saw the film? How come?

380
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,012
I didn´t see it,
but I swiped all the stills...

381
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,511
including the famous one!

382
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,267
She really is beautiful...

383
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,528
but she´s strange...
I can´t figure her out.

384
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:13,324
Let´s make the phone call!

385
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:48,666
Lucas, I´ve got bad news for you.

386
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:52,008
The Germans banned the play?

387
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,252
No...

388
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:56,639
You can´t leave next week.

389
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,851
The escape route fell through.

390
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:02,224
You said it was a sure thing.

391
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:03,984
It´s never sure.

392
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,148
The passer who guides people
through Nevers was arrested.

393
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:12,914
I´ve got another lead,
but it´s risky.

394
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:15,664
You´re afraid he´ll get caught too?

395
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,586
No, worse than that...

396
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:22,797
Some passers...
so-called passers...

397
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:25,803
after taking your money...

398
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,559
drive you straight
up to the Kommandantur.

399
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:32,109
So they get paid off
on both ends...

400
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,146
You´re a special case:

401
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,650
some people may recognize you,
or spot your accent.

402
00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:41,492
Let´s stay put for a while.

403
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,456
Will you be able to hold out?

404
00:28:44,752 --> 00:28:46,911
Of course I will... I must!

405
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:52,465
But l hate to feel so useless...
so trapped.

406
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:56,346
Did you talk to Jean-Loup?
Will he help us?

407
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,097
Frankly, I´d rather
keep him out of it...

408
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:03,019
He knows too many people.
He gossips, he fools around...

409
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:04,697
it´s too dangerous!

410
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,278
D´you know how many letters about
Jews are mailed to the police?

411
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,154
Guess!

412
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,577
I don´t know... 300?

413
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,200
1 500! 1 500 letters daily!

414
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,375
"My boss is Jewish,...
my neighbour is a Jew..."

415
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:19,047
No. They all think you´re gone...

416
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:22,180
Let´s keep it that way.
I´ll take care of you.

417
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:27,391
Did you think I was being polite?

418
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,692
Well, you´re wrong:
I want to look at your legs!

419
00:29:37,914 --> 00:29:41,117
Wait, let me breathe in
the smell of the stage.

420
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,510
From the cellar,
I follow all that goes on:

421
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:56,724
when the lights are dimmed in the
morning, I know it´s rehearsal time.

422
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,146
When they go on again,
it´s lunch time.

423
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:03,021
When all the lights go out
at night, it means...

424
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,483
you´re on your way down.

425
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:09,663
It reminds me of a play
I saw in London 3 years ago:

426
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,166
at night,
the husband would pretend...

427
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:15,749
to go out, but as soon
as the gaslight grew dim...

428
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,050
we knew it meant he´d come back
and was up in the attic.

429
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,638
Do you remember that play?

430
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:25,060
I almost acquired the rights.

431
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:34,526
He liked the Grand Guignol...

432
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:36,987
but he´s very happy to be with us.

433
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,585
He´s a little like Jean Gabin in
"The Human Beast": very physical...

434
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,458
and yet quite gentle.

435
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,090
He says it´s because of you
that he´s an actor.

436
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,842
No, I´ll do it myself.

437
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:53,433
Tell me how rehearsals are going.

438
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,982
Jean-Loup is doing well.

439
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:00,271
l was delighted today
when he blew his top!

440
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:09,167
Yes, just a minute.

441
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:13,038
Jean-Loup, it´s Daxiat.

442
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:14,420
What does he want?

443
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:15,750
I don´t know.

444
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:23,388
Hello, Daxiat. What´s up?

445
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:27,565
I heard it yesterday,
in the last metro.

446
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:30,485
They may stop rehearsals
of "The Dead Queen".

447
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:33,073
Why? Is Montherlant a Jew?

448
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,830
You´re pretty warm...

449
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:37,908
Daxiat wants to expose the Jews

450
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:40,079
who still work
at the Comédie Française.

451
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:43,092
He claims Jean Yonnel
is a Rumanian Jew.

452
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,136
I don´t know if Yonnel is Jewish,
or half-Jewish...

453
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:50,769
but I know
he should have run away...

454
00:31:51,063 --> 00:31:53,520
far away from these maniacs.

455
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:56,439
They´re really crazy...
all madmen.

456
00:31:57,364 --> 00:32:00,616
Not only in Germany, but here:
Daxiat and the others...

457
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:02,111
Madmen!

458
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:06,456
You wanted to know
what Bernard Granger looked like.

459
00:32:07,128 --> 00:32:09,121
He´s just perfect.

460
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:13,886
At least we don´t have to worry:
he looks like a real goy!

461
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,304
What have you got against goyim?

462
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,881
Nothing against...

463
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,725
those with short skirts
and long hair.

464
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,265
You dirty racist!

465
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,736
My mother warned me
I´d never be happy with a Jew.

466
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:33,122
"You know, Carl...

467
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,617
if you wish to remain
in this house...

468
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,337
you must never pronounce
the name of Charles-Henri.

469
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:45,383
Everyone noticed
my new dress last night...

470
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:47,593
except for you..."

471
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:49,935
That´s very good, Nadine...

472
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,068
but I want you
to move over to Bernard.

473
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,604
We´ll give you a lamp.

474
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,148
You´ll put it on the table...
it will help...

475
00:32:58,451 --> 00:32:59,995
Raymond, stop fooling around...

476
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,747
Go get us a lamp.

477
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,000
Let´s go on.

478
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,245
"Don´t tell me it´s your work."

479
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:08,085
"I know you work...

480
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:09,379
more than I do...

481
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,088
but some people in this house...

482
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:13,760
should keep...

483
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:16,301
their own duties in mind."

484
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,638
"Why do you say that?"

485
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:21,107
Because... it´s in the script!

486
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,988
Yes, it´s Daxiat.
Go over and say hello.

487
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:36,329
Be friendly. Remember he helped us
get the Censor´s visa.

488
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,424
Don´t worry. I´ll thank him.

489
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:43,300
Alright, kids. Let´s take a break.

490
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:48,428
Who´s he?

491
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:51,818
Don´t you know him:
he´s the lnspector-General...

492
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,272
Daxiat, the drama critic.

493
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,197
Is that Daxiat? I had no idea...

494
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,495
I´d love to meet him...

495
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,572
You´re not fussy!

496
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,248
He practically runs
the Comédie Française.

497
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:06,997
This may sound strange,
coming from me...

498
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,840
but I think your husband...

499
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:12,678
was wrong to leave France.

500
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,390
The new anti-Israelite laws...

501
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,979
apply to theatre speculators
and profiteers.

502
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:21,859
But your husband was a rare pearl:

503
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:25,648
the only Israelite
theatre director...

504
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:27,364
You can say Jewish!

505
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,791
He was at once
a brilliant executive...

506
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:35,125
a talented stage director
and an artist.

507
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:39,009
You see, the Germans
are deeply attached to culture.

508
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:42,474
They don´t want talented artists
to leave France.

509
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,725
But there´s no need
to worry about your play.

510
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:48,895
I´m certain Cottins
can handle the job.

511
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:52,199
Still, one wonders
why this play was chosen...

512
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,698
Even Pitoeff turned it down!

513
00:34:56,622 --> 00:35:00,324
D´you know Mrs Fabre?
She wants to ask you for a favor.

514
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,586
Yes, of course. I know Madame.

515
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,920
It´s about my son, Pierre.

516
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,760
What´s he doing here?

517
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:10,056
He likes to sniff around
at rehearsals...

518
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,473
when he´s interested in a play.

519
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,099
Will he write about us?

520
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:16,272
He will, or he won´t.

521
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:18,691
I wish he´d forget us.

522
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,614
Just stay here.

523
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,024
Look...

524
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:25,902
We´re all Catholics in our family...

525
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,330
Here´s the proof...

526
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,299
Fine... I´ll do my best...

527
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:40,132
Come and meet our little circle.

528
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:45,687
Nadine Marsac, the top student
of the Simon drama course...

529
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:47,608
Well?

530
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:49,648
He´s going to help me.

531
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:50,649
Bernard Granger...

532
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:51,900
our leading man...

533
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:55,991
straight out of the Grand Guignol,
as you see.

534
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,834
He plays Carl?

535
00:35:58,127 --> 00:35:58,708
Yes...

536
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:01,922
Strange... he´d be ideal as
"The Hairy Ape".

537
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:06,509
Raymond will show you the way out.

538
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,180
He doesn´t go for girls, does he?

539
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:14,900
Is it okay to ask you a question?

540
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,361
Look at this.

541
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:20,232
What do you call it?

542
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,280
A fishing rod.

543
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,404
But we also call it a gaulle.

544
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:26,743
Now, if we add a second one to it...

545
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,578
we get "Deux Gaulle"!

546
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:31,424
Bravo, Raymond...

547
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,214
You´re very witty!

548
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:54,121
I speak to you from the plant
of a journal...

549
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,042
that proclaims the truth!

550
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:59,458
I say the French theatre
must drive its Jews out...

551
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:03,009
from the rafters
to the prompter´s box!

552
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,880
For a Jewish prompter
at the "Menilmontant"...

553
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:09,720
will worm his way
to the high command of the Opera!

554
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:13,691
We must oust the Jew
from the stage and the wings...

555
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:15,565
and keep him out!

556
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:20,030
No Jew should be allowed
in a key position in theatre...

557
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,992
for his sordid practices
are bound to corrupt it!

558
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,288
<i>Let these "gentlemen" be warned...</i>

559
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:31,379
<i>that France is off-limits to Jews.</i>

560
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:36,722
<i>Only in this way can true Frenchmen
safeguard their nation!</i>

561
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,309
Here´s the money you asked for,
Mrs Steiner.

562
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:44,362
But I can´t raise
this amount every month.

563
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:46,399
Of course not.
This is exceptional.

564
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,658
In that case, there´s no problem.

565
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:53,033
Hello, Mr Merlin... Come in.

566
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:55,827
Marion, this is Rosette.

567
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:01,546
Put your samples on the desk
and run along home.

568
00:38:03,558 --> 00:38:05,182
How old are you?

569
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:07,766
I´ll be fourteen in 3 months.

570
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:10,473
You´re working...
don´t you go to school?

571
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:12,686
No, I don´t want to anymore.

572
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:14,363
D´you like the theatre?

573
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:15,856
Yes.

574
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:17,988
Come see our play.

575
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:22,666
She can´t come to the theatre:
the kid can´t go out at night!

576
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:24,621
Yes, I can!

577
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:29,087
3 months ago, I went to hear
Edith Piaf at the ABC Theatre.

578
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:33,056
I wore my scarf down to here...

579
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:35,724
so nobody could see it.
There was no trouble.

580
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:40,020
We´ll talk about it some other time.
Go home. It´s late.

581
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:48,113
I´m surprised at you, Marion!

582
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:52,125
Now, that child will insist
on seeing the play...

583
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,169
Her parents hate to deny her
anything, but they´ll blame me.

584
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,511
Forgive me, I´m sorry.

585
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,596
I was sympathetic because...

586
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,171
Are they French?

587
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:04,718
The girl is,
but her parents are Polish.

588
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:07,180
The father´s a tailor.
He works at home...

589
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:09,234
in an attic.

590
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:11,853
He can´t go out in the street...

591
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:14,482
on account of his thick accent.

592
00:39:14,993 --> 00:39:16,192
Like Lucas?

593
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,121
His is much worse...

594
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:20,824
Besides, he hardly speaks French...

595
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:25,004
lf a German asks him for directions,
he´d be trapped!

596
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:29,012
So he hides in his attic
and his wife manages for him.

597
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:31,847
Isn´t he scared of a denunciation?

598
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:34,019
Can´t they go to the Free zone?

599
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:35,975
They´d love to go...

600
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:38,980
but it costs a fortune
and they´re poor.

601
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,864
Got a date tonight?

602
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,038
Not really... I´m going home.

603
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:49,955
Let´s have dinner.

604
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,369
I´m sorry, I can´t.

605
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:54,426
You can´t spend every night
by yourself.

606
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,546
I´ve got to go home.

607
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,106
I´ve read them all,
Mrs Director.

608
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:06,559
Nothing of interest.

609
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,486
You can return them...

610
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,984
but first, make sure to burn
the reader´s notes...

611
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,993
they´re in my handwriting.

612
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,246
I´ll take care of it.

613
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,416
Let me explain
about the money:

614
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,710
I divided it in three wads.

615
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:27,505
The first is for the conveyor
who´ll take you to Vierzon.

616
00:40:27,806 --> 00:40:29,182
They call them conveyors?

617
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:30,556
Yes, conveyors.

618
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,977
He´s to be paid
before he drives off.

619
00:40:33,273 --> 00:40:36,395
You´ll be comfortable.
It´s a furniture moving van.

620
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:39,352
I´ll sit in an armchair,
like a minister!

621
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:41,946
Listen, Lucas. This is serious.

622
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:46,992
This wad is for the farmer who´ll
take you across the borderline.

623
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:50,746
His property is so big
that it extends over both zones.

624
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,837
At the furthest end,
you´re in the Free zone.

625
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:57,674
Let me guess:
the third wad is for Spain.

626
00:40:57,976 --> 00:41:00,303
For Spain and for the rest.

627
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:03,809
And in case you need more,
I brought this.

628
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:16,532
No Mrs! Not the jewelry.
Not – the – jewelry!

629
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:18,285
You may need it.

630
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:21,710
So will you. Bring it along
when you join me...

631
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,799
I want you to join me...

632
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,557
as soon as possible.

633
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,852
To be safe, I´ve got to play
the first 100 performances.

634
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:33,894
Good God! What confidence!

635
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,358
D´you think it will run till then?

636
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,445
That´s 6 months...

637
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:43,996
No, I want you to leave
after the 50th... no later!

638
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,212
I´ll tell them I´ve got a spot
on my lungs...

639
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,253
and to find another actress.

640
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:55,221
I´ll turn the management over
to Jean-Loup...

641
00:41:56,351 --> 00:42:00,433
and pretend I´m going to
a sanitarium. Then, I´ll join you...

642
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:03,267
And we´ll start from scratch.

643
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:22,627
I´m not a barber... stop fidgeting.

644
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:30,733
Don´t. It´s horrible!

645
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:35,739
I´m trying to feel Jewish.

646
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:38,910
It´s very hard to portray a Jew.

647
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:41,578
If you underplay, they´re skeptical.

648
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:46,289
If you overplay, they say:
"He doesn´t look Jewish."

649
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:49,171
What does it mean
"to look Jewish"?

650
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:50,883
Why ask me?

651
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,260
Don´t move around.

652
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:57,802
Listen, Marion...

653
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,736
I love that song.

654
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,197
<i>How could I resist his romancing...</i>

655
00:43:05,492 --> 00:43:08,614
<i>or forget his manly embrace?</i>

656
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:11,074
<i>My heart still believes...</i>

657
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:12,788
<i>all the sweet lies...</i>

658
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:16,291
<i>and the tender look in his eyes.</i>

659
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:18,919
<i>I, who loved him so...</i>

660
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:22,259
<i>the most wonderful man
of St. Jean.</i>

661
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,434
<i>He broke my heart...</i>

662
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:30,987
<i>didn´t say goodbye...
or tell me why.</i>

663
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,287
<i>He broke my heart...</i>

664
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:46,504
<i>didn´t say goodbye...
or tell me why.</i>

665
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:57,851
- How´s the garden?
- Okay.

666
00:43:58,151 --> 00:43:58,982
- Growing?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:01,236
Then, we can smoke!

668
00:44:10,295 --> 00:44:12,287
Jacquot, come here.

669
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:15,670
Listen.

670
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,168
Can you recite?

671
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:18,551
- Sure.
- Ready?

672
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:24,679
Try to say: "´Mother,
do you think Mr Carl will return?"

673
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:27,474
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl
will return?"

674
00:44:27,777 --> 00:44:29,023
Very good.

675
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:31,694
Now say:
"I like to study with him."

676
00:44:31,992 --> 00:44:33,570
"I like to study with him."

677
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,451
That´s fine!

678
00:45:27,155 --> 00:45:28,021
Hello!

679
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,565
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl
will return?"

680
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:32,197
What are you talking about?

681
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,825
"I like to study with him."

682
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:35,666
- What is this?
- It´s him.

683
00:45:36,794 --> 00:45:38,372
- Who?
- Him!

684
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,256
- It´s OK now!
- Good.

685
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:46,760
Nadine, are you ready?

686
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:48,559
You can come in.

687
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:56,233
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"

688
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,532
"Please do. Don´t forget the salve
for his hand."

689
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:01,912
"I´m through, Mother."

690
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:05,158
"Fine. Go to bed now."

691
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:09,467
Now, you walk to the stairway...

692
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:11,917
You stop on the second step.

693
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,511
Don´t fall! Now you say your line.

694
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:16,847
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"

695
00:46:17,145 --> 00:46:18,971
"What do you think, son?"

696
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:22,108
"He´ll come back.
I like to study with him."

697
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,148
That´s fine, Jacquot. Bravo!

698
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,818
At least, we´ve got one good actor
in our play.

699
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,279
That´s nice. Thanks a lot!

700
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:35,826
See you tomorrow.

701
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:40,717
Do I get a kiss too?

702
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:42,636
You get a handshake!

703
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:45,340
Since you insist...
please, allow me...

704
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:47,470
I´ll read your palm:

705
00:46:47,896 --> 00:46:50,898
there are two women in you...

706
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:54,403
Sorry, but neither one wants
to sleep with you!

707
00:46:55,197 --> 00:46:56,314
So long!

708
00:47:01,082 --> 00:47:03,325
It´s my own fault...

709
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:07,626
I was too obvious... too aggressive.
Now, she enjoys needling me!

710
00:47:10,012 --> 00:47:12,634
When her job´s over,
she´ll just vanish.

711
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:16,017
I´ve got to score with her
before opening night!

712
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:18,648
D´you have my size in tan?

713
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:18,983
D´you have my size in tan?

714
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:21,731
What´s this?
Stop bothering Mrs Steiner!

715
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:25,067
She´s no bother, Raymond.
It´s alright.

716
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:30,035
I´ll get you a size 7.

717
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:31,709
Don´t you need stockings?

718
00:47:32,002 --> 00:47:33,710
Sure, but I can´t afford them.

719
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:35,334
Are you kidding?

720
00:47:35,632 --> 00:47:36,462
Not at all...

721
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:38,088
I use make-up.

722
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:39,845
So do I.

723
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:42,464
You even drew the seams.

724
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:43,764
How chic!

725
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:47,348
To do it right,
one needs a helping hand.

726
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,607
GERMAN TROOPS
INVADE FREE ZONE

727
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:52,531
Is that today´s paper?

728
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:55,575
Did you know about it?

729
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:56,948
I heard it on the radio.

730
00:47:57,204 --> 00:47:59,244
People from the Free zone
will be happy...

731
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,793
They invaded the Free zone?
So what?

732
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:11,389
I´ll have to sneak across
all of France instead of just half.

733
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:13,476
No, the Germans are everywhere.

734
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:16,522
They search all the trucks.

735
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:19,439
The passer refuses to risk it...

736
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:22,027
It´s much too dangerous now.

737
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:24,994
What am I supposed to do?

738
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:27,531
Wait till things simmer down.

739
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,538
I can´t stay here. I´ll go crazy!

740
00:48:30,836 --> 00:48:32,496
This is no life.

741
00:48:32,796 --> 00:48:35,124
D´you know
how I kill time all day?

742
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:37,716
I read... I read a lot...

743
00:48:39,473 --> 00:48:42,013
I listen to lies on the radio.

744
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:44,934
Then I read lies in the press.

745
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:48,069
To keep from losing my mind...

746
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,735
I do crossword puzzles.

747
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:53,156
You want to see them?

748
00:48:53,453 --> 00:48:54,734
Just listen:

749
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:59,579
across, in 5 letters...
symbol of infamy: "kikes".

750
00:49:00,254 --> 00:49:03,210
Down, in 8 letters...

751
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:06,427
stinking vultures: "sheenies".

752
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:09,555
These are for the kiddies:

753
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:13,177
"You can never trust one"...
in 3 letters:

754
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,438
the first letter is a J...

755
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:19,900
So l give up, I listen to
the sounds in the theatre...

756
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:23,320
I wait for your footsteps
on the stairs.

757
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:27,205
I wait and wait.
I can´t wait anymore!

758
00:49:28,419 --> 00:49:31,172
How many years can a man live?

759
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,045
I can´t take it anymore...

760
00:49:35,763 --> 00:49:37,674
Please, Lucas...

761
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,142
I´m going!

762
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:44,640
Where?

763
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,862
Away from here.
I´ll speak to them!

764
00:49:48,156 --> 00:49:48,855
To whom?

765
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:51,483
The authorities... the police...
I´ll regularize...

766
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:54,159
my status. I´ll register.

767
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:56,117
Are you crazy?

768
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:58,293
Stay here! What do you want?

769
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:00,047
A concentration camp?

770
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:00,957
Let me go!

771
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:02,504
You´re not leaving...

772
00:50:03,762 --> 00:50:05,423
I won´t let you!

773
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:15,985
Here, it´s real cognac...
from the black market.

774
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:19,449
You´re shaking...
You´d better take a drink.

775
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:24,245
I just realized something awful:

776
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:26,416
I could kill a man...

777
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:33,219
We´ll fix up the cellar.
We´ll get a real bed...

778
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:36,469
a comfortable armchair
and some rugs.

779
00:50:37,352 --> 00:50:39,392
I need a desk.

780
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,555
You´ll have a real apartment.

781
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:46,111
I hope you won´t forget
the wallpaper.

782
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,520
Mrs Steiner wants a rifle
for the gamewarden.

783
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:19,368
We need an official permit
for a prop rifle...

784
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:21,242
It´s not so easy!

785
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,329
It´s what she wants.

786
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:26,204
I can´t go out that way.
They´re here.

787
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:31,178
We should have gotten up earlier.

788
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:33,216
- Use the back yard.
- Right.

789
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:36,932
- Marion...
- Yes?

790
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:39,307
Don´t forget to lock the door.

791
00:52:01,724 --> 00:52:04,096
They sent him to another stalag...

792
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:06,268
but he can´t tell me where it is...

793
00:52:09,401 --> 00:52:13,615
I mail them separately;
one of them might reach him.

794
00:52:13,908 --> 00:52:16,696
They fit me. I´m the same size
as your husband.

795
00:52:16,995 --> 00:52:19,867
He wasn´t my husband,
he was my number two.

796
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:23,918
I got them
at the Colonial Exposition...

797
00:52:24,214 --> 00:52:25,839
for cash, of course.

798
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,356
At times, he was fun...

799
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,395
but what a bastard!

800
00:52:40,654 --> 00:52:41,936
Hello, Bernard.

801
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:45,785
I bet you slept out:
you haven´t shaved.

802
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,409
Yes, I spent the night out:

803
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,871
I ran into a raid for
"Voluntary Labor in Germany".

804
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:56,382
Two guys were checking everybody.

805
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:58,718
So l turn this way and that way...

806
00:52:59,014 --> 00:53:01,886
Each guy thought the other
had checked me out!

807
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:05,648
It´s nothing to brag about:

808
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,777
that´s why our prisoners
can´t come home.

809
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:17,533
How come you´re dressing up here?

810
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:21,333
Don´t broadcast it.
Yes, I spent the night out.

811
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:37,273
I hate for a man to touch me.

812
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:39,943
Can´t you do this instead of him?

813
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,613
You want to know
how I feel about it?

814
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:45,611
Maybe I can´t stand
touching a man!

815
00:53:53,802 --> 00:53:56,009
Don´t forget my other costume.

816
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:58,265
What other costume?

817
00:53:58,558 --> 00:54:00,136
It´s written in the script:

818
00:54:00,436 --> 00:54:03,107
Act 2:
"Carl enters, wearing a frown."

819
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,227
I´d suggest something sober!

820
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,630
You know Granger?

821
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:25,961
The new actor?

822
00:54:26,265 --> 00:54:28,554
Yes. Tell him I couldn´t wait.

823
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:31,304
Say Christian left this.

824
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:33,149
I´ll give it to him.

825
00:55:09,286 --> 00:55:11,992
<i>Marion... are you there?</i>

826
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:13,405
Where are you?

827
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,375
<i>Go over to the bed
and say something.</i>

828
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:20,545
Say what? I´m by the bed.

829
00:55:21,053 --> 00:55:22,085
<i>I can´t hear.</i>

830
00:55:22,388 --> 00:55:24,465
Same here. I hardly hear you.

831
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,095
<i>Go over to the radio.</i>

832
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:30,477
Where is the radio?
I don´t see it.

833
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:33,612
<i>It´s next to the boiler.</i>

834
00:55:34,196 --> 00:55:35,656
The boiler?

835
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,965
Here I am.

836
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:54,259
Is it this hole?

837
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:57,976
<i>Yes. I hear you as if you were
by my side.</i>

838
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,725
<i>Turn the sound on loud
and come up to the stage.</i>

839
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:08,575
This is very dangerous.

840
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:09,488
It´s not...

841
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:10,786
It´s great!

842
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:15,627
I rigged up the old heating vent.
With this set-up...

843
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:19,792
I can hear all the rehearsals
from the cellar.

844
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,512
At night, I can give you suggestions
to pass on to Jean-Loup...

845
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:31,477
Now, "Disappearance" is sure to be
a hit... it could run for a year!

846
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:35,115
I´m back in business:
I´m directing again...

847
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:38,206
but strictly incognito!

848
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:53,225
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies...

849
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,311
lies and contradictions."

850
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:58,061
"They´re not lies, but blanks.

851
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:00,853
They´re not lies, but blanks.

852
00:57:01,155 --> 00:57:04,323
For years,
I tried to find out the truth.

853
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:08,738
It´s dreadful not to know
who one is... what one has done.

854
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,336
Even worse is the fear
it may occur again.

855
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,085
At times, I feel as if
I don´t really exist."

856
00:57:16,593 --> 00:57:20,178
"Why won´t Dr Sanders allow you
to consult a doctor?"

857
00:57:20,934 --> 00:57:24,682
<i>"He knows more than any doctor.
Without him, I´d be dead.</i>

858
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,390
<i>I´ll be eternally grateful to him."</i>

859
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,861
<i>"A prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer...</i>

860
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,612
<i>and Dr Sanders
has imprisoned you.</i>

861
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,830
<i>But if a man
tells you he loves you...</i>

862
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:39,033
why won´t you listen ?"

863
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:40,746
No... wait a minute.

864
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:44,381
Is it really necessary to shout
all these lines?

865
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:48,972
I don´t know...
it sounds all wrong to me.

866
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:52,053
Lucas´ notes are explicit:

867
00:57:52,354 --> 00:57:55,272
this scene is to be played
like a duel.

868
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:57,694
Like a duel!

869
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,647
Alright, but it seems absurd to me.

870
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,615
"A prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer...

871
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,123
and Dr Sanders
has imprisoned you.

872
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,421
But if a man
tells you he loves you...

873
00:58:12,716 --> 00:58:14,508
why won´t you listen?"

874
00:58:14,802 --> 00:58:18,055
"I have no right to love...
no right to love, or be loved."

875
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:21,683
You are simply voicing
Dr Sander´s words.

876
00:58:22,521 --> 00:58:25,524
"I will tell you something
about Dr Sanders."

877
00:58:26,945 --> 00:58:27,645
There...

878
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:32,447
You told me to shout, so I did.
But I´m not happy about it.

879
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:36,080
I´m not happy either.
You see, we´re not happy.

880
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:42,629
Granger´s right.
The scene should not be shouted.

881
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:46,256
But that´s what you asked for!

882
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:48,016
So I made a mistake...

883
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:51,514
Jean-Loup shouldn´t take my notes
so literally.

884
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:53,141
What´s that?

885
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:55,519
An electricity failure.

886
00:58:56,237 --> 00:58:57,317
Get a candle.

887
00:58:57,614 --> 00:58:58,611
A candle...

888
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:00,569
It´s on again.

889
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,377
It shouldn´t be played as a duel,
but as a conspiracy.

890
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:14,301
Am I boring you?

891
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:17,809
Sorry, I´m simply exhausted.

892
00:59:18,269 --> 00:59:20,347
Then sleep here...

893
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:23,441
No, I want to sleep at the hotel...

894
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:25,899
I´ll go home.

895
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:29,318
So, you´re deserting
the conjugal cave?

896
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,369
Goodnight.

897
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,663
Wait... wait.

898
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:41,506
I´m waiting.

899
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:50,476
I´ll see you tomorrow morning.

900
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:55,360
Raymond!

901
00:59:54,863 --> 00:59:55,694
Raymond!

902
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:58,690
Did you see him?

903
00:59:58,994 --> 00:59:59,575
No.

904
01:00:01,038 --> 01:00:02,784
Are you the electrician?

905
01:00:03,084 --> 01:00:06,038
No, not the electrician:
the engineer.

906
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:23,645
Here he is!

907
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:28,362
I know l´m late. While I stood
in line at the hardware store...

908
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:32,247
someone swipes my bike.
So I take the subway...

909
01:00:32,543 --> 01:00:35,545
It breaks down:
we´re stuck between two stations...

910
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,248
As always.

911
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,629
Why not take a bike-cab?
We´d have paid for it.

912
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,804
For his size, they charge double!

913
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:46,886
That´s why I don´t take them!
I´ve got my self-respect!

914
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:48,469
I was just kidding.

915
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:51,729
Can you see me spread out
like a pasha...

916
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,603
being hauled around
by a poor bastard on his bike?

917
01:00:56,619 --> 01:01:00,120
Sure, I know: fat men are funny...
good-natured clowns.

918
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:03,993
Well, I´m not a nice fat man...

919
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:06,207
I´m a nasty one... Go to hell!

920
01:01:10,388 --> 01:01:13,142
Listen, last year they stole
my bike too...

921
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:15,262
so I kissed it off.

922
01:01:15,563 --> 01:01:19,480
But 3 days later,
in another street... unbelievable!

923
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:22,649
What do I see?
My very own bike...

924
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:25,107
No. 813-HK-45.

925
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:27,452
So I figure I´ll take it back.

926
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,662
Just then, a creep walks up...
real cool...

927
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:34,130
I let him unfasten the lock.
Then I say:

928
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:37,509
"Look man, this is my bicycle!"

929
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:42,218
The creep acts indignant.
We swap insults...

930
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:46,185
People gather
around to watch the fight.

931
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:48,607
You know what he pulls?

932
01:01:48,903 --> 01:01:50,813
He calls me a fairy.
No offense, Jean-Loup.

933
01:01:51,114 --> 01:01:53,273
He claims I´m molesting him...

934
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:56,828
making indecent proposals...
the works!

935
01:01:57,373 --> 01:02:02,120
The people give me dirty looks.
They all side with the crook!

936
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:06,881
<i>A real lynch mob! So I beat it fast
and never looked back!</i>

937
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:11,308
There are the Boches, the Heinies...

938
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:16,266
the Krauts, the Jerries...
I don´t remember the other one...

939
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,525
You forgot the buzzards...

940
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:20,196
That´s right... the buzzards.

941
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,244
Say, that´s my record-player!

942
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,630
It´s not yours, it´s Marion´s.
She lent it to me for a party.

943
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:34,668
They swipe all my props:

944
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,295
when it´s not an armchair,
it´s a record-player.

945
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:04,251
A gentleman is waiting for you.

946
01:03:04,554 --> 01:03:06,761
I wonder who it is.

947
01:03:07,224 --> 01:03:10,559
I don´t know his name.
He writes in "Je Suis Partout".

948
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:12,645
Daxiat?

949
01:03:12,941 --> 01:03:14,601
Yes, it´s Mr Daxiat.

950
01:03:18,657 --> 01:03:20,651
May I speak with you?

951
01:03:20,952 --> 01:03:24,571
I wanted to meet you
outside the theatre...

952
01:03:24,873 --> 01:03:28,209
because it´s a confidential matter.

953
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,044
I know you don´t like me...

954
01:03:34,346 --> 01:03:36,921
but I daresay
it´s perhaps because...

955
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:38,423
you don´t know me.

956
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:40,187
I´m not judging you...

957
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,683
but your articles
have often hurt friends...

958
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:45,777
whose work I admire.

959
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:48,065
Others say you love the theatre.

960
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,481
I just don´t know.

961
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,367
Indeed, I am a paradox:

962
01:03:52,664 --> 01:03:54,457
I adore the theatre,
I live for it and yet,

963
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:56,957
I´m hated by most theatre people.

964
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:03,087
It requires strength of character
to cope with such hostility.

965
01:04:03,388 --> 01:04:05,547
I daresay I´ve got that strength.

966
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:08,633
I´ve always admired Lucas Steiner...

967
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:13,567
If he was here, I would tell him
our real struggle is socialistic...

968
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:17,816
anti-capitalistic... that we too,
are men of the Left...

969
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:21,581
but we go further:
we want revolution!

970
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:23,119
You know, Lucas...

971
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:26,537
read newspapers,
but only the theatre section.

972
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:28,417
I do the same. But politics...

973
01:04:28,718 --> 01:04:30,794
You´re wrong:
everything is political!

974
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:33,585
But that´s not what I´m here for...

975
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:39,771
Lucas Steiner is still in France.

976
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:56,123
We´re sorry...

977
01:04:56,422 --> 01:04:59,757
It´s stupid, but obligatory:
everybody down to the shelter!

978
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:16,568
That identity card was found
on a passer who was arrested.

979
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:23,082
Your husband must be
hiding out in some village...

980
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,831
but at some point,
he´s bound to contact you.

981
01:05:27,968 --> 01:05:30,045
Would you give him a message:

982
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:34,008
if he comes back, I won´t write
anything against him.

983
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:36,470
It´s a matter of honor.

984
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:39,230
But if he returns,
you´ll be compromised.

985
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,813
And what about your theatre?

986
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:44,987
The name of Steiner
can only harm you.

987
01:05:45,285 --> 01:05:47,824
You ought to get a divorce.

988
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:53,788
Do you remember, Marion?

989
01:05:55,049 --> 01:05:56,544
Remember what?

990
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:00,879
The elevator
of that department store.

991
01:06:01,182 --> 01:06:02,843
Yes, I remember...

992
01:06:03,687 --> 01:06:06,557
I felt they all knew
what we were doing...

993
01:06:06,857 --> 01:06:08,436
I was terrified...

994
01:06:09,068 --> 01:06:10,896
Only terrified?

995
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:14,491
No, not only terrified...

996
01:06:16,204 --> 01:06:20,120
But the night of that premiere...
There, you were scared...

997
01:06:20,419 --> 01:06:22,246
No, I enjoyed it...

998
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:26,051
Go on... go home...

999
01:06:26,343 --> 01:06:29,632
Go back to the hotel.
I´d rather you left right now.

1000
01:06:31,184 --> 01:06:33,142
What if I stay here tonight?

1001
01:06:33,854 --> 01:06:36,098
All night? Till tomorrow?

1002
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:38,684
All night. Till tomorrow!

1003
01:06:38,988 --> 01:06:40,018
You mean it?

1004
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:44,321
I´ll put out the light
to consider your proposition.

1005
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:51,334
"But if I tell you I love you...

1006
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,838
Why won´t you listen?"

1007
01:06:54,134 --> 01:06:56,887
I know it´s in the script,

1008
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,301
but l´d rather
you refrained during rehearsals.

1009
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:02,097
Save it for the perfomance!

1010
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:03,144
Let´s go on.

1011
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,190
"I have no right to love...
no right to love, or be loved."

1012
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,523
"But if I tell you I love you...

1013
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,369
why won´t you listen?"

1014
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,490
Bernard, you´re supposed to...

1015
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:18,500
caress her face just then.

1016
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:22,834
Marion told him not to touch her.

1017
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:30,139
<i>A large crowd is gathered here,</i>

1018
01:07:30,435 --> 01:07:33,604
<i>I´m trying
to make my way through...</i>

1019
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:35,179
<i>What was that?</i>

1020
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:38,479
<i>I´m told that blast is due to...</i>

1021
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:41,737
<i>an explosive device
in a record-player!</i>

1022
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:45,166
<i>Admiral Froelich
has been seriously injured.</i>

1023
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:47,918
<i>They tell me he was killed!</i>

1024
01:07:48,879 --> 01:07:51,798
<i>The ambush was set up
by some terrorists...</i>

1025
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:54,051
<i>A record-player exploded.</i>

1026
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:09,819
Excuse me, Mrs Steiner.

1027
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,614
I´m busy, Mr Merlin.

1028
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:13,113
Please: this is important.

1029
01:08:21,386 --> 01:08:23,177
I know who he is...

1030
01:08:23,471 --> 01:08:25,630
You shouldn´t sell your jewelry.

1031
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:28,686
Let me take it to a pawn shop.

1032
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:32,271
If the play´s a hit,
you can get it back.

1033
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,694
It makes sense.

1034
01:08:35,196 --> 01:08:36,607
Thank you, Mr Merlin.

1035
01:08:42,373 --> 01:08:45,410
I´m sorry, but I need some time...

1036
01:08:46,337 --> 01:08:47,915
to think it over.

1037
01:08:48,215 --> 01:08:49,626
As you wish.

1038
01:08:54,849 --> 01:08:58,718
Would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room?

1039
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:04,023
The kind of help you want
can be picked up in a brothel.

1040
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:07,275
I can rehearse you.

1041
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:09,902
Never mind. I´ll manage.

1042
01:09:10,205 --> 01:09:13,825
"Carl, if you wish to remain
in this house...

1043
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:17,130
you must never mention the name
of Charles-Henri."

1044
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:22,006
It´s at the perfume counter of
the Galeries. Ask for Miss Yolande.

1045
01:09:22,597 --> 01:09:26,300
She´ll let you have
"Gone With the Wind" for 80 Frs.

1046
01:09:26,603 --> 01:09:30,651
I wouldn´t spend that much
on a black market book...

1047
01:09:31,194 --> 01:09:33,318
but if Marion wants it...

1048
01:09:33,613 --> 01:09:34,693
Yes, she does.

1049
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:36,272
Then, I´ll get it.

1050
01:09:37,036 --> 01:09:41,415
Would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room?

1051
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:43,536
I´ve never done it.

1052
01:09:43,836 --> 01:09:46,709
It´s simple:
you just read the text.

1053
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:48,668
I say a line
and you answer me.

1054
01:09:48,969 --> 01:09:49,964
Alright.

1055
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:55,012
It´s a nice room!

1056
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:56,592
Yes, it is.

1057
01:09:56,897 --> 01:10:01,728
<i>Essentially, they´re profiteers.
Very few come here to work.</i>

1058
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:06,991
<i>The problem is that there´s no way
for most Frenchmen...</i>

1059
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:09,494
<i>to recognize a Jew.</i>

1060
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,876
<i>Ilf we could spot them,
we could protect ourselves.</i>

1061
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:16,836
<i>Some have typical racial features,
but not all of them!</i>

1062
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:19,806
<i>If only all Jews had blue skin,
but as it is...</i>

1063
01:10:20,098 --> 01:10:23,550
<i>we need a foolproof way
to detect them...</i>

1064
01:10:25,897 --> 01:10:28,735
They say: "It´s better
to hear that than to be deaf,"

1065
01:10:29,235 --> 01:10:32,440
but at times,
I´d rather be stone-deaf!

1066
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:37,122
How was our rehearsal?

1067
01:10:37,414 --> 01:10:40,785
Great...
I mean it was much better...

1068
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:44,084
The whispering improves the scene...

1069
01:10:44,382 --> 01:10:47,800
but you could add to the intimacy
by dimming the lights.

1070
01:10:48,097 --> 01:10:52,096
The faces could be illuminated
from the rear... as silhouettes.

1071
01:10:52,477 --> 01:10:54,970
Don´t move...
Remember, you´re silhouettes!

1072
01:10:55,273 --> 01:10:57,314
Raymond... if you don´t mind!

1073
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,064
You´re a genius, Jean-Loup.

1074
01:11:00,363 --> 01:11:03,816
I´ll shift the backdrop
to sharpen the silhouettes.

1075
01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:06,906
What the hell, Raymond?
We´re in the dark!

1076
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:09,663
l know!
The whole area´s in the dark!

1077
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,372
A light failure.

1078
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:13,499
Perfect for a shadow play!

1079
01:11:13,799 --> 01:11:16,588
The whole neighbourhood´s
blacked out.

1080
01:11:16,887 --> 01:11:19,130
You´d think they´d warn us.

1081
01:11:19,433 --> 01:11:21,141
Marc, let´s get some lamps.

1082
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:25,055
I know where we can get candles...
for cash, of course!

1083
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,920
Nadine, we´re waiting for you.

1084
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,553
Let me explain.

1085
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:50,766
No need to.

1086
01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:52,177
Don´t judge me.

1087
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,478
I´m not judging you...

1088
01:11:53,774 --> 01:11:56,729
but try to keep your love life
outside the theatre.

1089
01:12:02,828 --> 01:12:04,656
Marion´s heartless.

1090
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,450
She´s too tough...

1091
01:12:09,462 --> 01:12:11,208
She´s not interested in anyone.

1092
01:12:11,801 --> 01:12:14,720
She has no sympathy for anyone.

1093
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:17,339
She doesn´t know I´m alive.

1094
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,972
She´s worse since Lucas´ gone.
I can´t stand it!

1095
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:27,019
Calm down, child... calm down...

1096
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:30,357
It´s not the end of the world.

1097
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:33,995
She opened a door
that should have been locked.

1098
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:36,368
You see it as a tragedy, but...

1099
01:12:36,669 --> 01:12:39,422
in two weeks,
it will have been forgotten.

1100
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:42,214
I hope you´re right.

1101
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:45,632
I want to go home.

1102
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:49,186
Run along.

1103
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:00,142
Can I help?

1104
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:03,017
No, drop it.
You´re the last thing she needs.

1105
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:04,816
She´ll be alright.

1106
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:07,441
I hate to see her so upset.

1107
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:12,490
Christ! I really was
on the wrong track with her.

1108
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:14,620
That´s for sure!

1109
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,208
She´s no playmate for you...
she´s more like a competitor.

1110
01:13:19,053 --> 01:13:21,342
Were you really stuck on her?

1111
01:13:24,769 --> 01:13:26,808
I just wanted to sleep with her...

1112
01:13:27,105 --> 01:13:30,275
it was like a craving
for a warm croissant!

1113
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:33,524
I wanted to warn you to drop her,
but I figured...

1114
01:13:33,824 --> 01:13:35,781
it was none of my business.

1115
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:41,989
You´re all going to the Joconde
tonight? lt´s a cabaret.

1116
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:46,172
You know what the BBC says?
They say all those...

1117
01:13:46,466 --> 01:13:50,134
who go to night clubs will be held
to account after the war.

1118
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,811
Jean-Loup
wants to boost our morale.

1119
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:01,361
You...
you had the right to be moody...

1120
01:14:01,822 --> 01:14:04,824
to throw a party, or be by yourself.

1121
01:14:05,202 --> 01:14:10,197
Why am I expected to be charming
and smiling at all time?

1122
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:13,915
Even Jean-Loup picks on me.

1123
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:17,798
He´s right.
And he doesn´t know half of it!

1124
01:14:18,262 --> 01:14:21,847
I don´t mind that you neglect me...

1125
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:26,512
but for the others,
the play comes first.

1126
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:30,269
You must pay
more attention to them.

1127
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:33,949
Why don´t you answer?

1128
01:14:35,495 --> 01:14:37,324
I´d rather not.

1129
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:40,497
The coffee´s ready.
I´ve got to run.

1130
01:14:44,132 --> 01:14:45,414
Marion!

1131
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:46,800
Yes?

1132
01:14:47,097 --> 01:14:51,095
I heard you and Bernard
rehearsing the love scene.

1133
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:53,514
So what?

1134
01:14:54,064 --> 01:14:56,734
It seems to me... I feel...

1135
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:58,734
it might be improved.

1136
01:14:59,446 --> 01:15:00,775
What do you mean?

1137
01:15:01,532 --> 01:15:04,820
It´s the only love scene
in the play. Try to be...

1138
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:07,706
more sincere...

1139
01:15:57,364 --> 01:15:59,606
No, this seat´s for Bernard.

1140
01:16:00,576 --> 01:16:04,623
I can´t stay. I´ve got to meet
the producer of "Angels of Mercy".

1141
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:08,790
I´m not sure... it´s between me
and two other girls.

1142
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:12,625
I hope you get the role.

1143
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,132
We´ll pray for you.

1144
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:16,755
I´m off.

1145
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,286
She´ll be good...

1146
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:37,123
but they may feel she´s too young.

1147
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:38,453
She´d be better

1148
01:16:38,757 --> 01:16:40,381
in "School for Wives".

1149
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:42,752
Nadine in the role of Agnés?

1150
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:46,468
When she announces:
"The little kitten is dead..."

1151
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:50,352
the whole audience will think:
"She´s the one who killed it!"

1152
01:16:53,737 --> 01:16:55,647
Enjoying yourselves?

1153
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:57,730
Sit here!

1154
01:16:58,034 --> 01:17:01,950
Well, I´m not alone.
I brought a friend. Simone...

1155
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:03,874
Sit down.

1156
01:17:04,168 --> 01:17:06,839
Take care of her
while I check our things.

1157
01:17:11,762 --> 01:17:13,804
Arlette, sit next to me.

1158
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,395
Just a minute.

1159
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:34,491
Give those back.
I´ve changed my mind.

1160
01:17:45,144 --> 01:17:47,766
Sorry, Mrs Steiner. I can´t stay.

1161
01:17:49,859 --> 01:17:51,235
Come on, let´s go.

1162
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:53,070
I forgot... I´ve got a date.

1163
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:54,740
You´re free. We´re all free.

1164
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:57,572
I apologize. I´ll see you tomorrow.

1165
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:22,484
That man´s staring at us.
Don´t look. He´s coming over.

1166
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,533
Hello, Cottins.

1167
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,110
Still in show business...
a real trooper!

1168
01:18:28,749 --> 01:18:30,373
Introduce me.

1169
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:32,079
I forget your name.

1170
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:33,535
René Bernardini.

1171
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:37,126
Bernardini... Arlette Guillaume...
Marion Steiner.

1172
01:18:41,058 --> 01:18:42,635
I´ll be right back.

1173
01:18:43,143 --> 01:18:44,342
You promise!

1174
01:19:04,091 --> 01:19:07,591
This joint is tacky.
Let´s go to the Monseigneur.

1175
01:19:07,887 --> 01:19:10,046
No, Marion´s exhausted.

1176
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:14,016
Speak for yourself.
I feel like going there!

1177
01:19:14,815 --> 01:19:16,688
Wait for Arlette.

1178
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:18,609
No, you two are kill-joys.

1179
01:19:18,902 --> 01:19:21,147
I´m not sleepy.
It´s sinister here. Let´s go.

1180
01:19:26,497 --> 01:19:27,660
What´s up?

1181
01:19:27,959 --> 01:19:30,202
Tonight, I´m on my own.

1182
01:19:37,598 --> 01:19:38,796
What´s going on?

1183
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,298
That´s Marion:

1184
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:43,639
the party fizzles, so she opts
for an all-night disaster.

1185
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,496
I see Daxiat has two seats...

1186
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:01,663
I see Daxiat has two seats...

1187
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,591
in the 7th row.

1188
01:20:03,885 --> 01:20:06,459
Remember: 20 seats
for the Propagandastaffel!

1189
01:20:07,472 --> 01:20:11,093
Why look at me that way?
It´s mandatory:

1190
01:20:11,396 --> 01:20:13,602
20 seats every night.
It´s a rule.

1191
01:20:13,899 --> 01:20:17,270
At the Odeon, they put them
in the side boxes.

1192
01:20:17,654 --> 01:20:18,853
We´ll do the same!

1193
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:34,963
It´s too much!

1194
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:38,136
We give good seats
to those who pan us...

1195
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:41,057
and we turn down genuine fans.

1196
01:20:41,356 --> 01:20:44,975
Lucas would say: "We give
our best seats to our enemies."

1197
01:20:45,904 --> 01:20:49,322
My purse was in my dressing room.
It´s missing.

1198
01:20:50,577 --> 01:20:52,120
Oh, great!

1199
01:20:59,173 --> 01:21:02,175
What a mess!
Somebody searched this room.

1200
01:21:02,762 --> 01:21:03,343
Well?

1201
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:05,216
They took my travel clock.

1202
01:21:05,516 --> 01:21:07,842
I think that´s all they swiped.

1203
01:21:09,438 --> 01:21:10,469
And you?

1204
01:21:10,773 --> 01:21:13,148
They left my wallet,
but it´s empty.

1205
01:21:14,446 --> 01:21:15,775
It´s worse for you.

1206
01:21:16,073 --> 01:21:20,072
I don´t mind the money,
but my ration cards, my I. D. card,

1207
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,862
my work permit
and my pass were in my purse.

1208
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:26,956
I´m glad
I locked your door, Marion.

1209
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,751
I´ll get the police.

1210
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,925
No, we´ll do the searching.

1211
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:34,632
Just like at Radio-Paris:

1212
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:39,229
some "moving men" came for
the piano. They never returned it.

1213
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:41,481
They were moving men like I am!

1214
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:45,906
That´s fine, but I need my papers.
I wonder who did it.

1215
01:21:46,241 --> 01:21:49,777
Well, I know who did it...
I´m almost sure of it.

1216
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:53,997
Raymond, you know who I mean.
I guess you don´t agree...

1217
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:57,624
Yes, I do! It could only be her.

1218
01:21:57,924 --> 01:21:59,087
I guessed it at once...

1219
01:21:59,969 --> 01:22:00,715
Martine...

1220
01:22:01,011 --> 01:22:04,466
Raymond, you know where she lives.
Run over there...

1221
01:22:05,227 --> 01:22:07,054
No, I don´t know!

1222
01:22:07,354 --> 01:22:09,015
Come on, she´s your sweetie!

1223
01:22:09,316 --> 01:22:11,310
She´s not: she turned me down.

1224
01:22:11,611 --> 01:22:15,693
She peddles her black market stuff
around theatres. That´s how we met.

1225
01:22:15,951 --> 01:22:20,282
I took her out once. That´s all.
I don´t even know her address.

1226
01:22:20,874 --> 01:22:23,082
I´ve never been to her place...

1227
01:22:24,379 --> 01:22:26,373
but she´s a looker...

1228
01:22:26,674 --> 01:22:29,297
I let people think
we slept together.

1229
01:22:30,263 --> 01:22:31,924
Let´s call the police.

1230
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:37,018
I don´t want the police
to seet foot in this theatre.

1231
01:22:37,315 --> 01:22:38,809
This way, please...

1232
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:39,310
This way, please...

1233
01:22:39,693 --> 01:22:41,816
Clear the aisle. Thank you.

1234
01:22:42,487 --> 01:22:44,149
Any seats tonight?

1235
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:46,859
No, it´s opening night.

1236
01:22:52,794 --> 01:22:54,789
That´s Marion Steiner.

1237
01:22:58,887 --> 01:23:01,758
Where is Mrs Steiner´s office?

1238
01:23:02,057 --> 01:23:04,052
It´s on the landing.

1239
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:09,063
Her dressing room is there.

1240
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,901
No. Leave the flowers here.

1241
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:15,153
They´ll poison the air in there.

1242
01:23:30,766 --> 01:23:32,594
I hear them, Marion.

1243
01:23:43,076 --> 01:23:46,911
I don´t see how you can eat.
I couldn´t.

1244
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:48,453
Sure you can. Here.

1245
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:50,875
No, I swear I can´t.

1246
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:54,090
What if tonight´s a disaster?

1247
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,088
We´ll do a new play.

1248
01:23:56,386 --> 01:23:58,094
With what money?

1249
01:23:58,389 --> 01:24:00,928
Have you seen our accounts?
I have.

1250
01:24:01,226 --> 01:24:03,553
If it´s a flop,
we lose the theatre.

1251
01:24:03,855 --> 01:24:07,605
I´m terrified.
How can you be so calm?

1252
01:24:08,154 --> 01:24:11,441
Lucas, you picked the play,
you staged it...

1253
01:24:11,742 --> 01:24:13,403
we followed your advice.

1254
01:24:13,703 --> 01:24:16,789
It´s your creation.
If it doesn´t work...

1255
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,874
if it doesn´t work...

1256
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:22,085
I´m to blame, it´s my fault...
my own fault...

1257
01:24:22,592 --> 01:24:25,297
but we´ll all be up shit creek!

1258
01:24:25,595 --> 01:24:26,461
Have a drink.

1259
01:24:26,763 --> 01:24:29,470
I don´t know how you do it...

1260
01:24:29,769 --> 01:24:31,726
I feel faint...

1261
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:33,813
I´m sick to my stomach.

1262
01:24:34,107 --> 01:24:35,732
Just relax...

1263
01:24:36,737 --> 01:24:39,858
Wait, put this over your stomach...
sit down.

1264
01:24:44,748 --> 01:24:45,744
Thanks.

1265
01:24:48,587 --> 01:24:50,047
I must go now.

1266
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,341
We´ll talk later.

1267
01:24:52,635 --> 01:24:53,548
Sure.

1268
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:55,419
So long.

1269
01:24:55,972 --> 01:24:58,430
I should be reassuring you.

1270
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:01,599
There´s no need to.
I feel gay as a lark.

1271
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:56,218
"Isn´t Eric here?"

1272
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,677
"He was restless this morning.

1273
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,766
He´s probably at the gate,
watching the road."

1274
01:26:03,028 --> 01:26:06,362
"Dr Sanders wouldn´t allow him
to go to the station."

1275
01:26:06,657 --> 01:26:08,450
"My godfather knows best.

1276
01:26:08,745 --> 01:26:12,494
I suppose he wanted to speak
to the new tutor in private.

1277
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:16,540
But if I´d been consulted,
I´d say...

1278
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:18,547
Eric has no need for a tutor.

1279
01:26:19,259 --> 01:26:23,307
<i>He´s too young and I enjoy
teaching him the little I know."</i>

1280
01:26:23,807 --> 01:26:25,469
"You are right, Mrs...

1281
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:29,139
but this big house
is too quiet for Eric.

1282
01:26:30,066 --> 01:26:33,685
My mother says
that when she worked here...

1283
01:26:33,987 --> 01:26:36,278
she often served 20 dinner guests."

1284
01:26:37,453 --> 01:26:40,905
There are 25 of us in Paris:
we´re "public utilities".

1285
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:42,703
"On my birthday...

1286
01:26:43,002 --> 01:26:46,502
when Dr Sanders told me
I could eat with the grown-ups...

1287
01:26:46,798 --> 01:26:47,830
I cried."

1288
01:26:49,135 --> 01:26:51,175
How come she´s going in?

1289
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,714
My son is acting in this play!

1290
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,887
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"

1291
01:26:57,774 --> 01:26:58,639
You alright?

1292
01:26:58,941 --> 01:27:02,941
As the boss used to say:
"When you gotta go, you gotta go!"

1293
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:06,076
"Tell Eric to finish his homework."

1294
01:27:12,878 --> 01:27:15,963
"This is Mr Carl, our new tutor.

1295
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:18,087
I should have warned you...

1296
01:27:18,386 --> 01:27:20,594
The resemblance is striking...

1297
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,170
It´s truly amazing!"

1298
01:27:22,476 --> 01:27:24,302
"l don´t know what you mean.

1299
01:27:25,063 --> 01:27:27,733
But I expected an older man."

1300
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:30,434
"I´m an experienced teacher."

1301
01:27:30,737 --> 01:27:32,114
"I don´t doubt it.

1302
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:35,574
But so far, my son
has been raised solely by us.

1303
01:27:35,869 --> 01:27:39,821
I had hoped he might
be guided by someone who...

1304
01:27:40,127 --> 01:27:43,044
Still,
since my godfather trusts you...

1305
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,380
Eric, meet your new tutor."

1306
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:52,382
"Helena, be wary
of your faulty memory.

1307
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:55,478
Here are his credentials.

1308
01:27:56,274 --> 01:27:59,110
I showed them to you
a month ago."

1309
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:01,739
What a bastard!

1310
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:05,616
"You´re surely right,
I was confused..."

1311
01:28:05,912 --> 01:28:07,456
"Certainly
by the resemblance."

1312
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,825
"Every new face upsets me...

1313
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,500
But I´ll get used to him. Besides...

1314
01:28:12,798 --> 01:28:13,829
Eric seems happy."

1315
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:16,672
"Can I take Mr Carl
around the estate?"

1316
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:18,250
"Of course, child."

1317
01:28:21,853 --> 01:28:23,561
<i>"Listen, Gregory."</i>

1318
01:28:23,856 --> 01:28:26,892
<i>"When will you learn to trust me?</i>

1319
01:28:27,652 --> 01:28:30,608
<i>Don´t you realize
how I cherish you?</i>

1320
01:28:31,116 --> 01:28:32,196
<i>Besides..."</i>

1321
01:28:35,038 --> 01:28:38,124
<i>"l don´t want to lose you."</i>

1322
01:28:42,924 --> 01:28:44,633
Hurry up!

1323
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:49,841
Germaine,
we´ve only got five minutes!

1324
01:28:50,144 --> 01:28:51,722
Don´t turn around!

1325
01:28:52,021 --> 01:28:53,729
How did it go?

1326
01:28:54,023 --> 01:28:55,734
We´ll know when it´s over.

1327
01:28:59,657 --> 01:29:02,362
Watch it...

1328
01:29:02,953 --> 01:29:04,745
Easy...

1329
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:19,011
What´s going on?

1330
01:29:19,309 --> 01:29:20,853
We´re 5 minutes late.

1331
01:29:21,062 --> 01:29:23,186
Can´t we go in quietly?

1332
01:29:23,482 --> 01:29:25,726
"I must tell you about Dr Sanders."

1333
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,351
"You´ve no right!"

1334
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:29,447
"I must tell you, Helena:

1335
01:29:29,867 --> 01:29:33,035
Dr Sanders didn´t come back
after Charles-Henri´s death,

1336
01:29:33,247 --> 01:29:34,706
but before it."

1337
01:29:44,889 --> 01:29:48,425
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies...

1338
01:29:48,728 --> 01:29:51,100
lies and contradictions."

1339
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:53,938
"They weren´t lies, but blanks.

1340
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:57,365
I´ve spent years trying
to learn the truth.

1341
01:29:57,991 --> 01:30:01,528
It´s terrifying not to know
who I am, or what I did.

1342
01:30:02,038 --> 01:30:05,041
Worse yet, is the fear
that it may occur again.

1343
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,285
At times, I feel I don´t really exist."

1344
01:30:09,257 --> 01:30:12,961
"But when I told you I love you...

1345
01:30:14,265 --> 01:30:16,389
Why didn´t you listen?"

1346
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:19,348
I had no right to love,
don´t you see?

1347
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:22,270
No right to love, or be loved."

1348
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:29,327
"And now?"

1349
01:30:29,995 --> 01:30:33,579
"Now, I´m coming to love
and it hurts.

1350
01:30:34,502 --> 01:30:36,625
ls love painful?"

1351
01:30:37,673 --> 01:30:39,630
"Yes, love is painful.

1352
01:30:43,056 --> 01:30:46,509
Like a bird of prey,
it hovers over us...

1353
01:30:47,812 --> 01:30:50,269
as if to threaten us.

1354
01:30:51,985 --> 01:30:55,404
But it is also
a promise of happiness.

1355
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:58,701
You´re lovely, Helena...

1356
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,952
so lovely that it´s painful
to look at you."

1357
01:31:03,253 --> 01:31:05,411
"Yesterday, you said it was a joy."

1358
01:31:05,713 --> 01:31:08,964
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1359
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:28,364
We won!

1360
01:32:06,593 --> 01:32:10,212
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.

1361
01:32:06,843 --> 01:32:10,463
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.

1362
01:32:10,765 --> 01:32:13,222
You understand...
She´s got to rest.

1363
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,513
You can come in.

1364
01:32:16,065 --> 01:32:19,232
Send her a note.
She´ll appreciate it.

1365
01:32:19,528 --> 01:32:22,317
I didn´t know you were here.
Come in.

1366
01:32:22,616 --> 01:32:24,443
My husband´s with me.

1367
01:32:24,743 --> 01:32:26,072
So he is!

1368
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,162
Put them there.

1369
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,719
- You were wonderful.
- Thanks.

1370
01:32:41,769 --> 01:32:44,854
I knew the torn dress
would be effective.

1371
01:32:48,404 --> 01:32:50,646
Sorry, but they insist on it.

1372
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:54,912
Captain Wiedekind and his wife.

1373
01:32:56,998 --> 01:32:59,324
My husband doesn´t speak French.

1374
01:33:02,506 --> 01:33:05,841
Cheer up! You look grim.

1375
01:33:06,219 --> 01:33:08,593
I´m not. Here´s to you.

1376
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:25,655
It went smoothly.

1377
01:33:25,957 --> 01:33:27,665
Except for that louse, Daxiat.

1378
01:33:30,088 --> 01:33:32,165
What are you brooding about?

1379
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:35,503
I´m not. I was thinking
about the play.

1380
01:33:35,803 --> 01:33:39,306
I enjoyed playing with you.
I was really moved.

1381
01:33:40,227 --> 01:33:42,980
You gave a great performance.

1382
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:45,980
I´ll do better in a few days.

1383
01:33:46,529 --> 01:33:48,487
See that man over there?

1384
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:52,233
The one who´s by himself?

1385
01:33:52,538 --> 01:33:54,745
Yes. Please get him out of here.

1386
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,536
Leave it to me.

1387
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:05,128
Remember me?

1388
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,757
Yes. You can´t stay here...

1389
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,310
This is a private gathering...
A working session.

1390
01:34:11,605 --> 01:34:12,982
She´s expecting me.

1391
01:34:13,276 --> 01:34:16,396
She´s not expecting anyone.
She´s exhausted...

1392
01:34:16,696 --> 01:34:18,025
That way out!

1393
01:34:18,323 --> 01:34:19,699
Did she get my flowers?

1394
01:34:19,992 --> 01:34:21,702
Were those your roses?

1395
01:34:21,996 --> 01:34:25,081
They were so full of thorns
her hands were all bloody!

1396
01:34:26,377 --> 01:34:28,703
If I were you,
I´d go home real fast!

1397
01:34:31,092 --> 01:34:31,957
So long!

1398
01:34:42,525 --> 01:34:44,483
Thank you very much.

1399
01:34:45,654 --> 01:34:48,444
You were excellent!

1400
01:34:50,453 --> 01:34:52,660
Bravo, you were great!

1401
01:34:52,957 --> 01:34:54,916
I was? Thanks.

1402
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:02,803
Looking for someone?

1403
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:04,260
No, never mind.

1404
01:35:05,642 --> 01:35:06,971
Are you pleased?

1405
01:35:07,269 --> 01:35:09,559
I´m happy for Marion.

1406
01:35:10,107 --> 01:35:14,320
I don´t understand you.
You heard the applause! It´s a hit!

1407
01:35:14,614 --> 01:35:16,358
A hit... a hit...

1408
01:35:16,659 --> 01:35:18,865
Maybe so, but it´s far from perfect.

1409
01:35:19,162 --> 01:35:22,533
From down here,
you can tell all the weak spots.

1410
01:35:22,835 --> 01:35:25,789
I made notes.
I´ll read them to you.

1411
01:35:26,089 --> 01:35:27,666
Sit down.

1412
01:35:29,051 --> 01:35:31,673
In the first place...

1413
01:35:32,723 --> 01:35:35,593
Are you crazy?
We can´t do that now.

1414
01:35:36,019 --> 01:35:38,772
They´re waiting for me.
I can´t stay.

1415
01:35:39,065 --> 01:35:40,857
Come back later on.

1416
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:42,480
How can I?

1417
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:46,826
We´re all together up there.
You know what it´s like...

1418
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:48,993
Then, spend the night here.

1419
01:35:49,288 --> 01:35:51,959
That´s impossible. Be sensible.

1420
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:54,410
I´ll come down tomorrow morning.

1421
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:57,420
Then take my notes. Study them.

1422
01:35:57,717 --> 01:35:58,797
Alright.

1423
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,344
Wait... look at me!

1424
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:06,094
Where can I put them?
Keep them till tomorrow.

1425
01:36:08,649 --> 01:36:09,895
Kiss me...

1426
01:36:12,656 --> 01:36:13,937
Goodbye.

1427
01:36:32,769 --> 01:36:36,352
<i>Daxiat liked it.
He´ll give us a rave...</i>

1428
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:40,901
<i>Here´s Marion!</i>

1429
01:36:41,698 --> 01:36:43,655
<i>Where were you?</i>

1430
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:46,244
<i>Some champagne for Marion...</i>

1431
01:36:50,001 --> 01:36:52,040
I want the "Petit Parisien"...

1432
01:36:52,337 --> 01:36:54,830
"Aujourd´hui", "La Gerbe"...

1433
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,261
´´Comedia´´ and ´´Je Suis Partout.´´

1434
01:37:00,098 --> 01:37:01,759
Listen to Daxiat:

1435
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,137
"The Montmartre Theatre
has changed its management,

1436
01:37:04,438 --> 01:37:07,275
but not its spirit.
Its new play is a hazy vignette."

1437
01:37:07,568 --> 01:37:11,400
"Hazy!" Sure...
he missed the beginning.

1438
01:37:12,783 --> 01:37:13,566
"Colorless...

1439
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:17,405
and apolitical, it deliberately
ignores our real problems."

1440
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:19,370
Naturally!

1441
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:21,581
"Mrs Steiner maintains...

1442
01:37:21,881 --> 01:37:24,668
the tradition of Jewish nihilism...

1443
01:37:25,176 --> 01:37:28,178
which has always polluted
that theatre.

1444
01:37:28,473 --> 01:37:32,972
The play says nothing about Jews.
Yet, it reeks of Jewishness.

1445
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:38,358
As to the staging
by Jean-Loup Cottins...

1446
01:37:39,156 --> 01:37:42,989
it is merely an effeminate version
of Lucas Steiner´s style."

1447
01:37:43,453 --> 01:37:44,734
Hear, hear!

1448
01:37:47,459 --> 01:37:50,545
"What can I say
about Marion Steiner´s performance?

1449
01:37:50,839 --> 01:37:53,711
It´s all-pathos,
but unfit for the stage.

1450
01:37:54,845 --> 01:37:56,423
Back to the movies, Mrs!"

1451
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,257
See?

1452
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,680
"The only revelation
is Bernard Granger..."

1453
01:38:05,068 --> 01:38:08,152
"He creates a totally
convincing character.

1454
01:38:08,446 --> 01:38:09,989
A star is born."

1455
01:38:10,282 --> 01:38:11,315
At last!

1456
01:38:12,704 --> 01:38:13,949
It´s not funny.

1457
01:38:14,247 --> 01:38:18,294
No, but the other reviews are good.

1458
01:38:18,586 --> 01:38:21,624
With the booking we´ve got,
the play´s a winner.

1459
01:38:22,718 --> 01:38:24,378
Thanks to you, Marion.

1460
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:29,390
Your film fans come to see you
in the play.

1461
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:33,939
"...the Jewish nihilism
which polluted that theatre."

1462
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,646
He signed it, but it reads like
an anonymous letter!

1463
01:38:38,198 --> 01:38:39,314
You´re right.

1464
01:38:40,243 --> 01:38:43,661
Daxiat and company
have the same poisonous motives.

1465
01:38:44,582 --> 01:38:46,661
Before, they were nobodies...

1466
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:49,879
Now, they rule the country,
but for how long?

1467
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:53,711
Look at this passage...

1468
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,051
It´s about you.

1469
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:57,050
Me?

1470
01:38:57,352 --> 01:38:58,051
Yes...

1471
01:38:59,855 --> 01:39:01,267
Look here...

1472
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,733
"Not content to monopolize
our stage and screen...

1473
01:39:09,035 --> 01:39:12,203
the Jews steal
our most beautiful women."

1474
01:39:23,471 --> 01:39:25,678
They sound cheerful.

1475
01:39:25,975 --> 01:39:28,099
It´s a private party.

1476
01:39:54,807 --> 01:39:58,180
The director of the "Hebertot"
wants to meet you.

1477
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:27,266
Miss Bataille...

1478
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:29,306
Mr Daxiat...

1479
01:40:29,818 --> 01:40:33,105
Bravo! Congratulations.
You were fantastic!

1480
01:40:33,407 --> 01:40:35,863
Your article was outrageous!

1481
01:40:36,452 --> 01:40:38,695
Apologize to Mrs Steiner!

1482
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:40,029
Certainly not!

1483
01:40:40,332 --> 01:40:43,998
You´ll apologize
to the whole cast!

1484
01:40:44,295 --> 01:40:45,542
I won´t fight.

1485
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:47,086
Let´s go outside.

1486
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:49,378
You´re insane!

1487
01:40:54,686 --> 01:40:57,095
This is absurd!

1488
01:40:57,649 --> 01:40:59,310
You´re ridiculous!

1489
01:41:00,403 --> 01:41:02,812
Apologize to Mrs Steiner.

1490
01:41:05,702 --> 01:41:06,818
Apologize!

1491
01:41:07,122 --> 01:41:08,949
I won´t apologize for doing my job!

1492
01:41:15,467 --> 01:41:16,796
I won´t fight!

1493
01:41:17,094 --> 01:41:18,589
Yes, you will!

1494
01:41:18,888 --> 01:41:21,263
I refuse to fight!

1495
01:41:24,397 --> 01:41:26,852
I´m not a prize-fighter:
I´m a journalist!

1496
01:41:44,676 --> 01:41:48,047
You´re irresponsible!
How could you do this to us?

1497
01:41:48,348 --> 01:41:50,093
What about my theatre?

1498
01:41:50,393 --> 01:41:52,931
What about our play?

1499
01:41:53,438 --> 01:41:56,939
All you care about is your theatre!

1500
01:41:57,652 --> 01:41:59,277
"How are the bookings?"

1501
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:01,611
"Will we do a matinee at Xmas?"

1502
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:04,282
Yes, the theatres are full now,
but so are the jails!

1503
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:07,830
Listen, we´ll go on
playing together.

1504
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:10,332
But offstage,
don´t you dare speak to me!

1505
01:42:23,107 --> 01:42:24,482
<i>"You´re lovely...</i>

1506
01:42:24,775 --> 01:42:27,611
so lovely
it´s painful to look at you."

1507
01:42:28,237 --> 01:42:29,733
"You said it was a joy."

1508
01:42:30,032 --> 01:42:31,493
"lt is a joy...

1509
01:42:32,453 --> 01:42:34,362
yet it´s painful."

1510
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,406
Look at this...

1511
01:42:59,534 --> 01:43:00,733
lt´s crazy!

1512
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:05,580
Now that the play´s working out...

1513
01:43:06,294 --> 01:43:07,326
you can relax.

1514
01:43:09,214 --> 01:43:11,373
Why look at me that way...

1515
01:43:12,302 --> 01:43:14,461
At times, I feel you hate me.

1516
01:43:15,472 --> 01:43:16,967
Not at all...

1517
01:43:17,767 --> 01:43:20,141
I´d be crazy to hate you!

1518
01:43:20,605 --> 01:43:24,734
You are a little crazy!
I know you by heart.

1519
01:43:25,028 --> 01:43:26,439
I know you too.

1520
01:43:28,324 --> 01:43:30,995
For me,
that play belongs to the past.

1521
01:43:31,287 --> 01:43:32,996
I´ve got a new project:

1522
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,534
"The Magic Mountain"...

1523
01:43:38,214 --> 01:43:41,217
with a great role for you.
Are you listening?

1524
01:43:41,678 --> 01:43:42,424
Yes.

1525
01:43:42,721 --> 01:43:44,381
It´s about a cruel woman...

1526
01:43:44,973 --> 01:43:45,969
Me... cruel?

1527
01:43:46,349 --> 01:43:48,143
No, the character!

1528
01:43:48,938 --> 01:43:52,272
She´s gentle, tender,
in love, and yet...

1529
01:43:52,567 --> 01:43:55,060
she´s cruel.
She doesn´t mean to be...

1530
01:43:55,365 --> 01:43:56,693
She´s cruel despite herself.

1531
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:58,071
Cruel!

1532
01:43:58,368 --> 01:44:00,076
It´ll be wonderful!

1533
01:44:00,371 --> 01:44:03,243
No literature!
We´ll use everyday language.

1534
01:44:03,542 --> 01:44:05,785
I´ll use your own words, you see?

1535
01:44:07,339 --> 01:44:12,133
I see that from now on, everything
I say may be held against me.

1536
01:44:28,285 --> 01:44:29,365
Mr Daxiat?

1537
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:30,992
Over there.

1538
01:44:51,069 --> 01:44:55,115
I was reluctant to come,
but with you, one doesn´t know...

1539
01:44:55,409 --> 01:44:58,031
whether it´s an appointment,
or a summons.

1540
01:44:58,329 --> 01:45:01,201
Apparently,
you misread my review...

1541
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,244
Was that a review?

1542
01:45:03,669 --> 01:45:05,914
I´d say it was a vicious attack.

1543
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:10,879
Assuming it was, it wasn´t
aimed at you. On the contrary...

1544
01:45:22,197 --> 01:45:24,523
Across all the columns...

1545
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:27,443
And don´t forget
the exclamation mark.

1546
01:45:34,173 --> 01:45:37,839
I went to the theatre
expecting to see a play...

1547
01:45:38,137 --> 01:45:40,843
directed by Jean-Loup Cottins.

1548
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,931
Instead, I saw a nondescript show...

1549
01:45:46,231 --> 01:45:47,347
with no style.

1550
01:45:47,651 --> 01:45:51,435
I felt you were merely a front...
and worse yet...

1551
01:45:51,738 --> 01:45:54,029
a mouth-piece for a fugitive.

1552
01:45:54,744 --> 01:45:57,948
Normally, I´d answer in kind.

1553
01:45:58,249 --> 01:45:59,494
But as it is, I´ll just go.

1554
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:03,293
Wait...
I´ve got a proposition for you.

1555
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:05,630
Whatever it is, my answer is no!

1556
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:08,597
I want you to help me save
the "Montmartre".

1557
01:46:11,267 --> 01:46:15,813
Steiner turned it over to his wife
before running away...

1558
01:46:16,108 --> 01:46:18,778
I found out
the transaction is illegal...

1559
01:46:19,071 --> 01:46:21,645
because the transfer
was ante-dated.

1560
01:46:22,952 --> 01:46:26,867
This kind of transaction is labelled
a "fictitious aryanization".

1561
01:46:27,624 --> 01:46:29,452
Meaning what?

1562
01:46:30,046 --> 01:46:34,508
It means that legally, the theatre
doesn´t belong to anyone...

1563
01:46:34,801 --> 01:46:38,636
and the Germans can requisition it.
Unless...

1564
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:40,596
Unless what?

1565
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:46,024
Unless it is taken over
by someone they approve of.

1566
01:46:47,362 --> 01:46:49,818
Daxiat didn´t beat about the bush.

1567
01:46:50,116 --> 01:46:52,904
He proposed that they share
the management...

1568
01:46:53,746 --> 01:46:56,701
He´d select the plays.
Jean-Loup would direct.

1569
01:46:57,002 --> 01:46:59,244
I assume Jean-Loup refused.

1570
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:01,504
No, he didn´t. He couldn´t.

1571
01:47:01,799 --> 01:47:04,291
All he could do
was to stall for time.

1572
01:47:05,346 --> 01:47:08,846
The only way to fight Daxiat
is to appeal to a higher-up

1573
01:47:09,058 --> 01:47:11,468
like Dr Dietrich.

1574
01:47:11,771 --> 01:47:14,098
But Jean-Loup refuses to do it.

1575
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:17,855
Dr Dietrich, please.

1576
01:47:18,156 --> 01:47:20,612
On the first floor.

1577
01:47:28,712 --> 01:47:31,002
You´ll have to wait.

1578
01:48:05,808 --> 01:48:07,469
Dr Dietrich, please.

1579
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:09,099
That´s impossible.

1580
01:48:09,397 --> 01:48:11,141
I called him.
He´s expecting me.

1581
01:48:11,441 --> 01:48:12,722
What´s your name?

1582
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:14,522
Marion Steiner.

1583
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:18,151
I see you´ve got a 5 p. m.
appointment...

1584
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:19,994
but it´s impossible.

1585
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:21,747
I don´t mind waiting.

1586
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,246
I´m sorry.
It´s useless to wait:

1587
01:48:24,543 --> 01:48:27,117
Dr Dietrich left
for the Eastern front.

1588
01:48:27,421 --> 01:48:30,176
He was recalled for active duty.

1589
01:48:30,468 --> 01:48:31,963
Then, that´s that.

1590
01:48:37,853 --> 01:48:40,642
Mrs Steiner,
I´d like a word with you.

1591
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:52,739
I´m an admirer of yours...

1592
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:55,208
I am Lieutenant Berger.

1593
01:48:56,548 --> 01:48:58,423
About Dr Dietrich...

1594
01:49:00,762 --> 01:49:05,842
He´s not on the Eastern front:
he shot himself last night.

1595
01:49:08,732 --> 01:49:09,894
It´s tragic...

1596
01:49:10,485 --> 01:49:12,693
He admired you enormously...

1597
01:49:13,197 --> 01:49:15,024
and so do I.

1598
01:49:16,118 --> 01:49:18,574
It´s an honor to shake your hand.

1599
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:16,243
I must speak to you.

1600
01:52:16,543 --> 01:52:19,379
I´m sorry,
but it´s absolutely necessary.

1601
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,509
I´m leaving the theatre.

1602
01:52:22,803 --> 01:52:25,840
But I´ll give you time to find
another actor.

1603
01:52:26,849 --> 01:52:29,176
I should have expected this.

1604
01:52:29,479 --> 01:52:32,185
No, it´s not what you think...

1605
01:52:34,153 --> 01:52:36,645
You can´t forgive my row
with Daxiat...

1606
01:52:36,948 --> 01:52:39,191
and I understand your reaction.

1607
01:52:41,455 --> 01:52:44,291
But even if you won´t speak to me,

1608
01:52:45,668 --> 01:52:47,663
we are a good acting-team.

1609
01:52:47,965 --> 01:52:52,295
I love the play and I love my role.
So it´s not that.

1610
01:52:52,596 --> 01:52:54,803
There´s no need to justify yourself.

1611
01:52:56,018 --> 01:52:58,854
I´m not even sure
we´ll replace you...

1612
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:02,066
The theatre
may soon be shut down.

1613
01:53:02,986 --> 01:53:06,191
I suppose you got a better offer
from Hebertot.

1614
01:53:06,491 --> 01:53:10,027
No, it´s not for Hebertot
or any other theatre.

1615
01:53:10,331 --> 01:53:13,665
I´m temporarily giving up acting...

1616
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:16,880
to join the Resistance.

1617
01:53:21,638 --> 01:53:24,807
"Helena, I wish to speak to Mr Carl
in private."

1618
01:53:25,102 --> 01:53:26,893
"If it´s about my son...

1619
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:30,563
I have the right to listen."

1620
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,316
Civil Defense!

1621
01:53:33,613 --> 01:53:35,155
Cellar inspection!

1622
01:53:35,615 --> 01:53:37,241
"Mr Carl, isn´t it unfair?

1623
01:53:37,535 --> 01:53:40,206
As Eric´s mother,
I have the right to know."

1624
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:42,622
"Frankly, Dr Sanders...

1625
01:53:42,918 --> 01:53:44,496
this is embarrassing."

1626
01:53:45,255 --> 01:53:47,082
"Never mind, Mr Carl.

1627
01:53:47,384 --> 01:53:49,791
Helena, please do as I say."

1628
01:53:50,595 --> 01:53:53,551
"Since you insist, I´ll leave."

1629
01:53:54,977 --> 01:53:56,556
"This is what happened:

1630
01:53:57,314 --> 01:54:01,230
last October, she went for a walk...

1631
01:54:01,529 --> 01:54:03,189
and simply disappeared."

1632
01:54:03,489 --> 01:54:04,818
It´s for the cellar.

1633
01:54:05,117 --> 01:54:06,529
- The cellar?
- Yes.

1634
01:54:06,829 --> 01:54:07,991
Out of the question!

1635
01:54:08,288 --> 01:54:10,745
"When she came back,
she was unable...

1636
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,621
to tell us where she´d been."

1637
01:54:13,547 --> 01:54:15,125
"Was she amnesic?"

1638
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,623
"I suppose so."

1639
01:54:18,886 --> 01:54:20,964
Put them in a side box.

1640
01:54:23,227 --> 01:54:24,971
Follow me.

1641
01:54:25,897 --> 01:54:27,273
"You´re right...

1642
01:54:27,567 --> 01:54:31,862
Helena´s dependency on me
may seem peculiar.

1643
01:54:32,281 --> 01:54:35,617
She behaves like a child.

1644
01:54:36,413 --> 01:54:39,166
Her gratitude is excessive."

1645
01:54:41,045 --> 01:54:43,334
"At times, she seems too humble."

1646
01:54:43,631 --> 01:54:46,966
"Why she feels guilty,
I don´t know.

1647
01:54:47,929 --> 01:54:50,847
But whatever it is, it leads her...

1648
01:54:51,141 --> 01:54:53,977
to seek the affection
of her inferiors:

1649
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:57,606
Charles-Henri
was bewildered by it.

1650
01:54:57,901 --> 01:54:59,811
And then the tragedy occured."

1651
01:55:00,988 --> 01:55:02,449
"What tragedy?"

1652
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:13,082
"I know Dr Sanders...

1653
01:55:13,382 --> 01:55:16,634
came back before
Charles-Henri´s death!"

1654
01:55:25,358 --> 01:55:26,603
D´you know them?

1655
01:55:26,901 --> 01:55:27,897
Civil Defense.

1656
01:55:28,195 --> 01:55:31,032
No, they´re Gestapo men.
I know one of them.

1657
01:55:31,492 --> 01:55:32,607
Gestapo?

1658
01:55:33,036 --> 01:55:34,696
- Will you help me?
- Yes.

1659
01:55:34,996 --> 01:55:36,277
But no questions!

1660
01:55:37,792 --> 01:55:39,252
"Love is painful.

1661
01:55:39,546 --> 01:55:42,167
Like a bird of prey,
it hovers over us...

1662
01:55:42,465 --> 01:55:44,045
as if to threaten us.

1663
01:55:44,344 --> 01:55:47,096
But it is also a promise
of happiness.

1664
01:55:48,892 --> 01:55:50,886
You´re so lovely, Helena...

1665
01:55:51,687 --> 01:55:54,180
that it´s painful to look at you."

1666
01:55:55,526 --> 01:55:56,856
"You said it was a joy."

1667
01:55:57,154 --> 01:55:59,528
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1668
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,455
No curtain calls tonight.

1669
01:56:12,801 --> 01:56:13,964
What´s up?

1670
01:56:14,261 --> 01:56:16,967
It´s Civil Defense...
to inspect the cellar.

1671
01:56:37,127 --> 01:56:39,252
This is Bernard Granger.

1672
01:56:39,548 --> 01:56:41,340
Bernard... my husband.

1673
01:56:53,652 --> 01:56:57,437
Don´t just stand there! You´ve got
to conceal all this and hide!

1674
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:06,411
Take us to the cellar!

1675
01:57:06,712 --> 01:57:09,715
No... wait for Mrs Steiner.

1676
01:57:12,094 --> 01:57:13,090
I´m going in.

1677
01:57:13,388 --> 01:57:15,050
No, she´s not dressed.

1678
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:17,474
Let´s be gentlemanly.

1679
01:57:19,272 --> 01:57:20,896
So I made a mistake!

1680
01:57:21,775 --> 01:57:23,354
Be patient.

1681
01:57:23,653 --> 01:57:25,196
I´ll be right out.

1682
01:57:35,127 --> 01:57:38,332
I never go down there.
It´s probably full of rats.

1683
01:57:38,548 --> 01:57:40,092
Have you got the key?

1684
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:43,512
Watch your heads!

1685
01:57:58,870 --> 01:58:02,572
Seems to me it´s not deep enough
for a shelter.

1686
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:05,962
There´s about 8"
between the ceiling and the yard.

1687
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:11,795
What´s this?

1688
01:58:12,097 --> 01:58:14,305
We used it in "The Cherry Orchard".

1689
01:58:15,812 --> 01:58:18,269
There´s only room for 40 people.

1690
01:58:18,816 --> 01:58:22,352
In any case,
it´s been condemned since 39.

1691
01:58:24,073 --> 01:58:26,696
During air-raids,
we use the subway.

1692
01:58:26,995 --> 01:58:29,866
The local station is open all night.

1693
01:58:32,628 --> 01:58:36,674
Can we use that staircase
for firewood?

1694
01:58:46,814 --> 01:58:48,938
There are so many air-raids now...

1695
01:58:49,234 --> 01:58:51,524
nobody bothers to go down.

1696
01:58:55,076 --> 01:58:58,447
Well, they cleared out...
till the next time.

1697
01:59:00,042 --> 01:59:02,249
This is a hell of a life!

1698
01:59:02,545 --> 01:59:04,455
It´s a life... it´s my life.

1699
01:59:05,591 --> 01:59:08,131
Can´t you find
a better hiding place?

1700
01:59:09,055 --> 01:59:11,973
I don´t want one.
This is my place...

1701
01:59:14,855 --> 01:59:17,015
and this is where I stay!

1702
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:21,149
My wife is beautiful,
isn´t she?

1703
01:59:23,826 --> 01:59:25,784
Let me ask you a question:

1704
01:59:26,538 --> 01:59:30,372
she´s in love with you,
but do you love her?

1705
01:59:37,137 --> 01:59:39,547
"I´m coming to love and it hurts.

1706
01:59:37,512 --> 01:59:39,922
I´m coming to love and it hurts.

1707
01:59:41,727 --> 01:59:43,009
Is love painful?"

1708
01:59:43,313 --> 01:59:45,021
"Yes, love is painful.

1709
01:59:45,315 --> 01:59:47,939
Like birds of prey,
it hovers over us...

1710
01:59:48,237 --> 01:59:50,397
as if to threaten us.

1711
01:59:50,699 --> 01:59:52,988
But it is a promise of happiness.

1712
01:59:58,209 --> 01:59:59,752
You´re so lovely...

1713
02:00:00,336 --> 02:00:03,124
that it´s painful to look at you."

1714
02:00:03,967 --> 02:00:05,759
"You said it was a joy."

1715
02:00:06,054 --> 02:00:08,676
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1716
02:00:18,822 --> 02:00:21,609
Bernard, may I ask you something?

1717
02:00:22,911 --> 02:00:25,914
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

1718
02:00:26,208 --> 02:00:27,619
Of course not...

1719
02:00:29,003 --> 02:00:31,757
I was waiting
for the rehearsal to end.

1720
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:34,542
Well, it´s over now. It was sad...

1721
02:00:35,555 --> 02:00:37,048
I watched it.

1722
02:00:37,556 --> 02:00:38,257
Well?

1723
02:00:38,559 --> 02:00:39,805
He was good.

1724
02:00:40,396 --> 02:00:43,516
It´s a lesson in humility:
we´re all expendable.

1725
02:00:48,324 --> 02:00:51,029
Well, goodbye Bernard...

1726
02:01:13,108 --> 02:01:16,359
I felt you were interested
in all women...

1727
02:01:16,655 --> 02:01:18,233
except for me.

1728
02:01:18,532 --> 02:01:20,359
First, it´s not all women...

1729
02:01:21,745 --> 02:01:23,621
and you intimidated me.

1730
02:01:23,915 --> 02:01:26,372
You seemed to disapprove of me.

1731
02:01:26,669 --> 02:01:29,506
At times,
you were downright hostile.

1732
02:01:29,966 --> 02:01:31,425
Hostile?

1733
02:01:31,719 --> 02:01:34,007
Yes, I felt you were judging me.

1734
02:01:34,305 --> 02:01:35,504
It´s just the opposite!

1735
02:01:36,476 --> 02:01:39,394
I was so attracted to you...

1736
02:01:41,107 --> 02:01:45,356
that I covered up
so nobody would notice...

1737
02:01:46,615 --> 02:01:48,609
and I made you hate me.

1738
02:01:48,911 --> 02:01:51,485
That´s not true.
I never hated you.

1739
02:01:53,625 --> 02:01:57,210
But why did you act so distant
after you´d kissed me?

1740
02:01:57,799 --> 02:01:59,672
All actors kiss each other.

1741
02:01:59,968 --> 02:02:01,676
But not on the mouth!

1742
02:02:02,471 --> 02:02:04,630
I kissed you on the mouth?

1743
02:02:05,059 --> 02:02:05,925
Yes...

1744
02:02:06,937 --> 02:02:10,473
on opening night.

1745
02:02:11,276 --> 02:02:13,150
I couldn´t have!

1746
02:02:13,445 --> 02:02:16,020
You kissed me on the mouth!

1747
02:02:18,954 --> 02:02:21,279
I know: you see two women in me.

1748
02:02:22,459 --> 02:02:23,408
I do:

1749
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:27,752
I see two women in you:

1750
02:02:28,759 --> 02:02:30,254
one who no longer
loves her husband...

1751
02:02:30,553 --> 02:02:31,717
No, don´t...

1752
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:36,640
You wouldn´t understand.

1753
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:49,906
Don´t forget your make-up.

1754
02:02:50,332 --> 02:02:51,708
I won´t need it.

1755
02:02:53,295 --> 02:02:55,204
I´ll leave it for my successor.

1756
02:02:57,342 --> 02:02:59,419
I won´t be using any make-up.

1757
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:02,802
But you may need a disguise.

1758
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:05,341
Forgive me...

1759
02:03:42,991 --> 02:03:46,907
<i>And so, Lucien Ballard
took over the part of Carl.</i>

1760
02:03:53,005 --> 02:03:54,630
<i>Nadine Marsac, now famous,</i>

1761
02:03:54,841 --> 02:03:57,547
<i>rushes off
right after her final lines.</i>

1762
02:03:57,762 --> 02:04:00,847
<i>A chauffeur drives her
to the studios...</i>

1763
02:04:01,141 --> 02:04:04,263
<i>where they´re shooting
"Angels of Mercy" at night.</i>

1764
02:04:05,024 --> 02:04:08,524
<i>Arlette Guillaume
is the art director of the film.</i>

1765
02:04:10,572 --> 02:04:13,360
<i>In June 1944,
the Allies land in Normandy.</i>

1766
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,987
<i>Despite the daily hardships...</i>

1767
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:19,706
<i>Parisians keep on crowding
the theatres.</i>

1768
02:04:24,593 --> 02:04:25,507
<i>One night...</i>

1769
02:04:25,802 --> 02:04:27,428
<i>ignoring the sirens...</i>

1770
02:04:27,722 --> 02:04:29,762
<i>the audience stood outside...</i>

1771
02:04:30,059 --> 02:04:33,228
<i>to watch the ballet
of the RAF planes in the sky.</i>

1772
02:04:44,121 --> 02:04:47,206
<i>Many theatres are shut down
for lack of electricity.</i>

1773
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:51,960
<i>Thanks to Raymond´s ingenuity,
the "Montmartre" remains open.</i>

1774
02:04:53,259 --> 02:04:57,093
<i>He´s replaced the footlights
by auto headlights</i>

1775
02:05:04,274 --> 02:05:06,482
<i>Germany´s defeat
is now inevitable.</i>

1776
02:05:06,779 --> 02:05:09,982
<i>After 813 days and nights
in his dark cellar...</i>

1777
02:05:10,283 --> 02:05:12,526
<i>Lucas Steiner is impatient
to see daylight.</i>

1778
02:05:13,789 --> 02:05:15,034
<i>The street...</i>

1779
02:05:15,374 --> 02:05:19,040
<i>is a scene of confusion
and sporadic shooting.</i>

1780
02:05:27,976 --> 02:05:28,592
No...

1781
02:05:28,894 --> 02:05:30,269
Not there!

1782
02:05:44,124 --> 02:05:46,497
<i>It´s a hectic period for Jean-Loup.</i>

1783
02:05:46,794 --> 02:05:48,420
<i>Arrested by the F.F.I.,</i>

1784
02:05:48,715 --> 02:05:51,919
<i>he is released
thanks to his connections...</i>

1785
02:05:52,219 --> 02:05:55,554
<i>but re-arrested the next day
because of his connections.</i>

1786
02:05:58,186 --> 02:06:01,141
<i>As for Daxiat,
he is a man on the run.</i>

1787
02:06:02,984 --> 02:06:05,821
<i>The one-time press lord
is now a pariah.</i>

1788
02:06:06,114 --> 02:06:08,690
<i>He´s survived the bombing
of Hamburg.</i>

1789
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:11,283
<i>After following Petain to Germany...</i>

1790
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:14,618
<i>he reaches Spain
via a series of monasteries.</i>

1791
02:06:14,918 --> 02:06:16,414
<i>Sentenced to death in absentia,</i>

1792
02:06:16,630 --> 02:06:19,465
<i>he will die of a cancer
in the ´60´s.</i>

1793
02:06:20,927 --> 02:06:23,502
<i>But let us go back
to the summer of 1944...</i>

1794
02:06:23,806 --> 02:06:25,716
<i>and to our story.</i>

1795
02:07:14,212 --> 02:07:16,455
I tried to forget you. I couldn´t.

1796
02:07:16,757 --> 02:07:19,760
If not for your pride,
I´d have come sooner.

1797
02:07:20,054 --> 02:07:23,674
You´d have had to make up
a lie each time you came.

1798
02:07:23,976 --> 02:07:26,849
Why should I lie? And to whom?
He´s dead now.

1799
02:07:27,649 --> 02:07:29,440
But you´ve got your career...

1800
02:07:29,734 --> 02:07:33,817
No. I realized I didn´t care
about it anymore...

1801
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:35,944
I gave it all up.

1802
02:07:36,912 --> 02:07:39,583
The only thing that matters to me...

1803
02:07:39,874 --> 02:07:43,042
is to be with you,
to get you out of here.

1804
02:07:43,337 --> 02:07:45,246
We can start all over again.

1805
02:07:45,548 --> 02:07:47,008
No we can´t.

1806
02:07:47,468 --> 02:07:50,423
There was never anything...

1807
02:07:50,806 --> 02:07:52,005
anything real...

1808
02:07:52,308 --> 02:07:53,388
between us.

1809
02:07:53,686 --> 02:07:54,800
I toyed with the idea...

1810
02:07:55,104 --> 02:07:57,477
but I never really loved you.

1811
02:07:58,817 --> 02:08:01,311
It was an abstract notion.

1812
02:08:02,156 --> 02:08:05,527
You believed in it
because I believed it myself.

1813
02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:09,864
I never stopped thinking of you...
not even for a day.

1814
02:08:10,251 --> 02:08:11,876
I thought of you too...

1815
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:13,915
but less and less often.

1816
02:08:14,132 --> 02:08:16,541
And now, I don´t know
what you´re doing here.

1817
02:08:16,761 --> 02:08:20,011
I´ve almost forgotten your name...

1818
02:08:21,475 --> 02:08:25,855
I barely remember
the way you look.

1819
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:27,645
Go away!

1820
02:08:31,866 --> 02:08:34,274
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.

1821
02:08:34,577 --> 02:08:36,406
It takes two to love...

1822
02:08:36,789 --> 02:08:40,242
as it takes two to hate.
And I´ll go on loving you.

1823
02:08:41,088 --> 02:08:44,873
You make my heart beat faster.
Nothing else matters to me.

1824
02:08:46,637 --> 02:08:47,882
Goodbye.

1825
02:09:31,034 --> 02:09:32,363
There´s Steiner!

1826
02:09:35,374 --> 02:09:36,288
He´s back!

1
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,159
What time is it?

2
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:03,921
Ten to four

3
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:06,043
What time is it, now?

4
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,686
Nine to four

5
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,884
Up yours, queer!

6
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:14,835
Eight to four

7
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:17,160
Where's Doinel?

8
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:20,963
Here I am. Why?

9
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,202
Let's go

10
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:24,244
Can I take a leak?

11
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,319
Not till six

12
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,484
Lousy fink bastard!

13
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,319
You shouldn't have hit that guard

14
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,125
Doinel, pee for us

15
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,845
Get laid for us!

16
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,402
At five sharp

17
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:38,958
We'll think of you at five!

18
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,878
Pvt. Doinel is here

19
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:02,918
You probe the ground
with your bayonet

20
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:07,925
And you think,
"Ah, I feel something hard!"

21
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,757
That's what your girl says
when you're home on leave

22
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:16,117
Well, mines are like dames

23
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:18,279
You have to go gently

24
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:22,000
With a girl you don't feel
her ass right away

25
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:24,599
You fiddle around

26
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:27,685
With a mine it's the same thing

27
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,358
Study it while I'm gone

28
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,238
Well, you finally made it

29
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:42,359
It's just as well,
for you and for us

30
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,003
Some individuals are hopeless

31
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,481
They just clutter up the army

32
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:51,680
Here's your record

33
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:54,687
Pvt. Antoine Doinel enlisted
for 3 years...

34
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,520
discharged from the army...

35
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,963
as unfit for service

36
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,602
There are boys
who don't like the army

37
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,042
They're drafted and they serve

38
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:09,246
But they don't volunteer!
Why did you enlist?

39
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,879
I had personal reasons

40
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,837
A girl, naturally!

41
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:21,242
The army is no refuge.
What's more, you've spent...

42
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:22,766
your enlistment bonus.

43
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:25,122
They should make you give it back

44
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:26,680
I would...

45
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,721
You must have pull...
communist friends

46
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,881
They run everything nowadays

47
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:37,480
Assigned to Vidauban. AWOL

48
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,725
Sent to Strasbourg. AWOL

49
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:44,483
Confined to barracks
at Dupleix. AWOL

50
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:46,366
You're always AWOL

51
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,482
And you had your civvies stolen

52
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:56,076
You'll have to send
your uniform back

53
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,725
Honorable discharge denied

54
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,718
by order of the General himself

55
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,796
Which means...

56
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,437
you can never work
for the government...

57
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:11,075
or any respectable company

58
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:13,601
You can always peddle ties...

59
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,235
But I doubt that you'll sell many

60
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,282
I hope we never meet again.
Dismissed!

61
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,837
You have to pay for the room!

62
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,121
It's 8 francs

63
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:16,845
Ginette got picked up again

64
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,320
Leave her something

65
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,478
That's the third time

66
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,603
We'll bring her sandwiches

67
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,644
Not me!

68
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,680
Not on the mouth!

69
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,239
Never with customers

70
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:50,917
Don't! I've got spray on

71
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll keep it on. I've got a cold

72
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:03,565
Come here. I'll wash you

73
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:05,401
Where are you going?

74
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,205
I'm always at the Balto

75
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,842
If I'm not there,
just wait 10 minutes

76
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,643
How about Saturday?

77
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,877
Okay, fatso

78
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,086
You going in or out?

79
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,363
I don't know. I'll follow you

80
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,921
You're my first soldier today

81
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,399
You'll bring me luck

82
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,396
What are you in?

83
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,920
I was in the artillery

84
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,679
Great!

85
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,437
I love big guns!

86
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:25,918
Won't Lucien be surprised!

87
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:27,960
Lucien, look who's here!

88
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,844
Long time no see

89
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,920
Are you on leave?

90
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,597
No. Discharged

91
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:40,042
- Have you eaten?
- Yes. Don't bother

92
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,636
I'm sure you haven't. Sit down

93
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:46,241
Too bad Christine's not here

94
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,199
Did you get sick? Is it temporary?

95
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,717
No. Permanent...

96
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,960
Psychologically unfit.
That works even in wartime

97
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:57,926
Good for you!

98
00:09:58,087 --> 00:09:59,918
The army is like...

99
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,362
the theatre...
a wonderful anachronism

100
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,557
We never knew why you enlisted

101
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,606
I'd read
Military Servitude and Greatness...

102
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,519
and I believed it

103
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,679
And now...

104
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,280
you're looking for a job?

105
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:20,642
I'd like to find something

106
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:22,480
What about Shapiro?

107
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,843
The Hotel Alsina

108
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,366
You're right! I'll call him

109
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,605
He's a customer.
He has a hotel in Montmartre

110
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,486
His night watchman just died

111
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,921
Would that suit you?

112
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,315
Lt'd be fine

113
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,803
You wanted to see Christine

114
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,318
I'll call her tomorrow

115
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,364
No. She's gone skiing...

116
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,438
with some friends, for a week

117
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:54,724
The conservatory is closed down.
There's a new dean

118
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,436
The students preferred the old one.
So they're out on strike

119
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,876
It's Mr Shapiro

120
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:15,079
I heard you mention Christine.
What did you tell him?

121
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:18,320
The truth

122
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,046
What should I tell him?

123
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,079
That's all right

124
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:26,323
He told me to come over right away

125
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,163
I think I'd better go now because...

126
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,204
Before you finish your cheese?

127
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:36,197
Go ahead. Being a night watchman
isn't bad

128
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:38,517
You have time to read

129
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,843
And Shapiro is a nice guy

130
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,123
I'll tell Christine you're back

131
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,722
Hello, Christine

132
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,081
Hello, Antoine

133
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,756
I'm glad to see you.
You haven't changed

134
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,403
- So you got out?
- Finally

135
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,365
That's what my parents said

136
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,959
Did you just get home?

137
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
I came right over

138
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:36,439
Do you like it here?

139
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,882
It's peaceful

140
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,960
My parents were afraid
you'd catch cold. They sent this

141
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:45,125
Vitamins. It's nice of you, but...

142
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:47,517
Take some now, or you'll forget

143
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:51,395
Do you want something to drink?

144
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,761
What is there?

145
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,919
Anything... Mineral water... coke

146
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,486
A coke

147
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,437
I didn't think I'd see you again.
You haven't written for 6 months

148
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:14,325
I was usually in jail
or in the hospital

149
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:17,441
And at first, when I wrote...

150
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,725
you didn't answer very often

151
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:23,277
Yes, I did!
But you wrote so many letters

152
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:27,438
Once I counted...
I got 19 in one week

153
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,515
I wondered when you found
time to write

154
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,081
So did I

155
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:35,761
And they weren't all so nice

156
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,323
What's your day off?

157
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:40,123
Wednesday

158
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,482
Come to dinner.
Mother said to ask you

159
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,684
You bet... absolutely... positively

160
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,679
Has Mrs Colin come down yet?

161
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,280
I haven't seen anyone

162
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:27,919
I was supposed to meet her at 6.
And I'm late myself

163
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:30,317
We'll miss our train to London!

164
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,643
The boat won't wait for us

165
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,756
Didn't she ask you to wake her?

166
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,436
You're half asleep yourself!

167
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:42,487
Let me see it

168
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,400
6 o'clock - room 18. 6:15...

169
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,046
There! Room 24

170
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,801
Let's go. Take your key.

171
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,959
I know her... She probably took
a sleeping pill

172
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:54,800
Hurry up!

173
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:57,957
- What floor?
- Third

174
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:03,240
If we miss that train,
we'll miss the boat

175
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:10,882
Open the door

176
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:13,641
She takes sleeping pills.
Turn the light on

177
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:16,801
Julien, what are you doing?

178
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:20,003
Your husband?

179
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,126
None of my business

180
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:26,243
Julien! This is too much!

181
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,485
My mother was right!
You're pathetic!

182
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:31,636
Hopeless!

183
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,164
Just look at yourself...

184
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:38,439
No, no... not that way!

185
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,040
What's the point?

186
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,005
We've got to be noisy
Now... go on!

187
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:44,316
You're crazy!

188
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,756
Not the flowers! The vase!

189
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:52,126
That's great! Keep it up!

190
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,079
Go call the police

191
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,000
He's breaking everything!
He's crazy!

192
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,958
Call the cops!

193
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,358
Say it's an emergency!

194
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:12,003
Tell them it's serious.
They'll get here faster

195
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:14,804
Very good

196
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:17,317
Fire Department?

197
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,284
No! The cops! Dial 17

198
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:24,165
This is for you. Buy some candy

199
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,038
Hello, Police?

200
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,405
This is the Hotel Alsina

201
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,799
On the 3rd floor...

202
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:33,764
Say they're breaking everything

203
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,679
They're breaking everything

204
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:39,956
Keep it

205
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:40,957
What's going on?

206
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,286
A man just found his wife...

207
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,082
The lady in no. 24 was with no. 19

208
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:48,680
You let him in!

209
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,838
He told me to hurry

210
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:53,567
You're a private detective!
Get out of here!

211
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,126
You too!

212
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,003
Here's your bonus...

213
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,805
And this is for Christmas

214
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,283
What'll you have?

215
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:22,926
I just ordered

216
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,884
You pulled a fast one!

217
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,924
Are you a private detective?

218
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,559
I've been with the Blady Agency
for 30 years

219
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:34,843
Haven't you seen the ads...

220
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,441
on the phone book covers?

221
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,805
You didn't see me at the hotel
last night

222
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:46,043
But I was there...

223
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:48,960
when Mrs Colin
and her lover went upstairs

224
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,923
I knew they'd be in bed together

225
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,123
All I needed was proof

226
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,365
Why didn't you call the cops then?

227
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:57,960
They wouldn't have come

228
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:01,563
My client would have had to appeal
to the District Attorney

229
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:04,560
The D.A. Would have called
the police

230
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,197
They come and what do they do?

231
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:12,524
The cops note
that at a certain time...

232
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,076
they saw a Mr Colin...

233
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:18,398
go into a hotel room...

234
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,559
and assault two persons
in the same bed

235
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:26,437
One of the persons being
the wife of said Colin

236
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,960
Generally, the cops only come
for disturbance of the peace

237
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:36,917
But in this case,
we got official proof of adultery

238
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,005
- Not bad!
- It's a job

239
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,325
I've got to go

240
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,245
I had a phone call to make

241
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,762
Oh, I'll do it at the office

242
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:54,285
Hey, you lost your job, didn't you?

243
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:07,202
Where's Mother?

244
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,642
The trains are on strike
till tomorrow

245
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:11,604
But the table is set for 3

246
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:13,325
Look who's behind you

247
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,602
I thought you were coming
Wednesday

248
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:19,916
He left the hotel

249
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:20,917
He got fired

250
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,002
- So he's looking for a job?
- No, I've got one

251
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:25,202
What's he doing?

252
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,200
You'll never guess

253
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:30,801
A newsboy?

254
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,958
Better than that

255
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,446
- A porter at Orly?
- That takes pull

256
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,876
- A painter?
- That takes talent

257
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:45,721
A writer?

258
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:47,600
No money in that

259
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:49,681
A water taster?

260
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,407
It's a good job. I saw one on T.V.

261
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,842
No. Less tiring

262
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,406
A cab driver?

263
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,844
You're getting warm

264
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:02,557
A poet?

265
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:07,118
Less intellectual. More dangerous

266
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,403
- I give up.
- I said dangerous

267
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:13,720
Shall I give you a hint?

268
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,086
Does he use a gun?

269
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:18,805
No. A spy glass!

270
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:22,676
I give up

271
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,724
I'll give you a hint

272
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:26,797
Sheriff?

273
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:29,720
Sure.
Didn't you see his horse outside?

274
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:32,242
I'm a private detective!

275
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:35,598
Yeah. Antoine Bond...

276
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:36,637
F.B.I.

277
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,561
You know the Blady Agency...

278
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:44,807
all kinds of investigations

279
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:47,716
Oh, that's great!

280
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,686
I want to hear about it

281
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,366
Come and help me

282
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:58,996
I can't stay long.
I'm meeting some friends

283
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,919
Do you mind?

284
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:02,756
You're sure, now?

285
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:05,043
I don't mind at all

286
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:06,999
If you did, would you tell me?

287
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,523
No, I would not.
But I don't really mind

288
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,363
I'll make you sing

289
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:43,642
I'm no canary

290
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,206
I object, your Honor

291
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,962
Anything you say
may be held against you

292
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,724
Catherine, you did
a good job in London

293
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,157
But why all that room service?

294
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:01,160
The London Hilton is at the angle

295
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:04,603
And I covered both doors
from my window

296
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,405
What's new on the textile case?

297
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:10,639
The salesgirl doesn't take
anything out

298
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:14,087
We've tailed her for 3 weeks

299
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:18,277
She can't conceal anything
in her coat and her bag's too small

300
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,438
She's no thief

301
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:25,844
We'll drop it. I have a hunch

302
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:28,682
I think her boss made it all up

303
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:32,961
He's in love with her...

304
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:36,319
and was looking for some way
to get to her

305
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:39,277
And he didn't dare tell me the truth

306
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:42,484
Like the guy at the Ministry
3 years ago

307
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,683
But he came to a bad end

308
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,362
Yeah. He hanged himself

309
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,559
No, he shot himself

310
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:53,525
He hanged himself from a beam...

311
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,325
in the attic of the Ministry...

312
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:58,445
Hanging doesn't make
your brains splatter

313
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:00,996
With the belt of his bathrobe

314
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,556
You always want
the last word, Henri

315
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,397
I argued with your father...

316
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:09,166
when you were in knee pants

317
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:10,646
Doinel, you stay

318
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:13,719
My father had lots of patience.
But mine is limited

319
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,477
Limited is right!

320
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:18,046
Mr Albany is here

321
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:19,401
Show him in

322
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:22,604
You wait there

323
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:48,845
Come and sit down

324
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:56,279
It's about a friend...

325
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,925
who lived with me

326
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:00,362
A month ago...

327
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:01,921
he disappeared

328
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:02,998
He left...

329
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:06,637
some things
and I'd like to return them

330
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,682
You want his address?

331
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:14,516
Yes, but not only that

332
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,798
I'd like to know how he lives...

333
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,878
what he's doing, whom he sees

334
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:23,525
I understand. We'll find...

335
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:24,676
his address...

336
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:25,916
tail him...

337
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:27,802
and investigate

338
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,162
It will cost you...

339
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:31,521
300 francs a day

340
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:35,803
Fine. Will it take...

341
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:37,562
very long?

342
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:40,844
It depends on whether your friend...

343
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,920
the gentleman...

344
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,605
is hard to find or not.
What is his profession?

345
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,160
He's a magician

346
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:53,079
He does an act
with colored cords

347
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:56,801
I always do the puzzle

348
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,239
Bring your book

349
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,518
I'll get on it right away

350
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:09,798
Call me in a few days

351
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,161
Is Doinel there?

352
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:22,280
Are you sure
that you know yourself?

353
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:25,517
Because I need to understand you

354
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,247
Just bear in mind
that we are not the F.B.I.

355
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:32,002
We never impersonate
police inspectors

356
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,042
We use initiative and cunning

357
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:04,041
Over there, every Thursday
they serve salt pork and lentils

358
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:14,479
I came to see Christine

359
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:15,762
She's out

360
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,521
Come in and have some coffee

361
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:44,801
Shall I come tonight?

362
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:48,357
No. I said Saturday.
Or never, if that doesn't suit you

363
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,518
Saturday's fine

364
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,686
You look upset. What's wrong?

365
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,079
Catherine is impossible!

366
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,238
She refuses to get married!

367
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,080
I've been after my girl
for 2 years...

368
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:13,726
and I know it won't work

369
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,559
Why not get yourself a whore?

370
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:17,160
They're too filthy

371
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:21,086
At your age I ate french fries
in the street...

372
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:22,885
and laid slobs...

373
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:25,607
who used safety pins on their bras

374
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,476
But now, I can't take them

375
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,717
I've got a date
with a real tall girl

376
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,765
What do you do when a girl
is taller than you are?

377
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:37,719
Nothing special

378
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:40,043
I mean a tall, tall girl

379
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:42,482
When you go out, if she's too...

380
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,036
Just look professional!

381
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:02,437
How did it go, with the girl?

382
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,436
At first it was depressing

383
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:08,765
But later on, it was fantastic!

384
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:11,395
The walls shook... it was real wild!

385
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:16,443
When my grandfather died...

386
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,804
I was sad, and my cousin
cried like crazy

387
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,561
There was a big family dinner

388
00:30:22,727 --> 00:30:25,764
Right after dessert
we went to the attic...

389
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,679
and I laid her on the floor

390
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:32,398
If anybody had found us,
it would have seemed monstrous

391
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:35,406
Yet, to make love is a way
of compensating for death...

392
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,444
of proving you exist

393
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,245
Christine will be here soon

394
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:00,682
Are you going to an early show?

395
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,441
No, we're going to a night club...

396
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,245
for a case I'm on

397
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,682
It must be fascinating!

398
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:11,119
It is. For instance, today...

399
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:16,001
a woman asked us
to find out why,

400
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:21,366
although their nursemaid
takes them out every day,

401
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:26,597
her twin babies seemed so pale...

402
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:29,238
Since she goes to work...

403
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:31,915
she can't follow the nurse

404
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:34,203
Well, they had me tail her

405
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:36,365
And this afternoon...

406
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,645
I waited
in front of her apartment house

407
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,318
The nurse came out with the twins

408
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:47,446
She took them to a little park.
And I followed them

409
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,723
Where's that thing?

410
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,925
Oh, you came for Christine

411
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,203
What happened in the park?

412
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,603
She rushed right through it...

413
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,644
came out the other end

414
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:04,877
She went into a building

415
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,196
She left the twins
with the concierge...

416
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:11,803
in a filthy room

417
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,284
Then she came out...

418
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:17,405
crossed the street
and went into a strip joint...

419
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:20,600
where she did the "nursemaid strip"

420
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,758
She took off her uniform...

421
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:24,997
and did things
with the baby's bottle

422
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:27,283
And since it was a continous show...

423
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,961
she did an encore 15 minutes later

424
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:34,156
Then she went back
to the concierge's...

425
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,726
to pick up the twins

426
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,924
She tipped the concierge
and took them home

427
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,681
No wonder they looked sickly!

428
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:46,601
I made out my report
and called it into the office

429
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:48,446
Fantastic!

430
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:50,120
Have you been here long?

431
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:52,039
At least 2 hours

432
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,835
What are you looking for?

433
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,077
I can't find Langman's address

434
00:32:57,607 --> 00:32:59,837
I want to send his wife some flowers

435
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:01,998
Call him. We have his phone number

436
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:04,158
And what do I say?

437
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,887
"Give me your address
so I can send you flowers"

438
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:10,198
You've got his phone number
but not his address?

439
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,677
Langman... 5255573

440
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:14,680
That's simple

441
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:16,280
Leave it to me

442
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:23,285
What are you doing?

443
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,278
Is this 5255573?

444
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:30,675
Mrs Langman?

445
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:34,644
If I say, "Chiquita"
what do you answer?

446
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,397
Banana!

447
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:39,127
You just won 5 bunches of bananas!

448
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:41,801
What address shall we send them to?

449
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:43,721
6 rue Ribera

450
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:46,082
Fine. And congratulations!

451
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:47,596
That was brilliant!

452
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,917
One of the tricks of the trade

453
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:53,798
Are we going to the movies?

454
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:56,037
No, I've got to go to a night club.
On a case

455
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:58,516
It's a nice place. There's a show

456
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:00,642
Do you mind?

457
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:04,959
No. If it's light, you'll behave
better than at the movies...

458
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,765
and I'll have some peace

459
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:47,959
There was an old sailor...

460
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,960
a magician and a story-teller...

461
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:55,323
a living legend

462
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,597
Children...

463
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:04,442
would crowd around him
on the wharf

464
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:08,403
As he played with braided cords,
he told them...

465
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,926
strange tales

466
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:12,601
He had all kinds of cords,
all lengths...

467
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,564
all colors

468
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:17,560
White and red...

469
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,439
green and yellow

470
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:23,124
Orange and wine, purple and blue

471
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:29,039
He'd pretend not to see us

472
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:31,118
But we saw him

473
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:34,357
He'd roll up the gold cord...

474
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,841
and put it down

475
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:40,277
Then, as if he were performing...

476
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:41,880
a sacred ritual...

477
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:44,519
as if he were seeking...
who knows...

478
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:48,077
a lost science... slowly...

479
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,236
we'd see him...

480
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,921
knot the blue cord...

481
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:56,043
wind it around his hand

482
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,796
And the knots would go
from the blue cord...

483
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,360
over to the gold cord

484
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:08,758
And from the gold cord...

485
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,525
back to the blue cord

486
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:17,036
And no one paid any attention
to his story

487
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,403
As soon as he wound
the blue cord on his hand...

488
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,956
the knots would go from the blue...

489
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:24,595
to the gold

490
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:26,320
Then back again...

491
00:36:26,487 --> 00:36:28,159
to the blue

492
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:32,398
Once again the knots would go
from the blue cord...

493
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:36,637
to the gold cord

494
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:49,921
Excuse me. I've got to go.
It's for my job

495
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,485
I must kiss you!

496
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:20,205
Albert, you remember Antoine?

497
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,486
Albert, my husband

498
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:23,915
What are you doing here?

499
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:25,560
Waiting for a friend

500
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,242
You're wondering
if it's a boy or a girl

501
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,916
You must come to dinner
some night

502
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:36,358
Do you have my phone number?

503
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,200
I think so

504
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,597
You haven't called lately

505
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:43,920
You didn't used to be afraid
of the phone

506
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:46,486
See you soon

507
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:18,884
I'm calling because...

508
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:21,322
I left you in sort of a hurry

509
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,998
I hope you're not mad.
It was for my job

510
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:27,437
I had to tail a guy...

511
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:30,679
you know, the magician.
You're not angry?

512
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:33,839
No. You detectives...

513
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:36,595
You say that. But you sound...

514
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:38,686
a little resentful

515
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:40,166
No. Not at all

516
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,882
We could go out tonight...

517
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:46,924
or do something. I'd like to

518
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,282
So would I. But I'm a little tired

519
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:51,324
I went to the demonstration

520
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:56,081
With cops and clubs and everything?

521
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,119
You know Marie?

522
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:01,520
She got hit

523
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:03,405
They're terrible!

524
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,161
Her father is suing the police

525
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,758
Don't cut us off, miss!

526
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:13,081
I can't hear you, Christine

527
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:16,243
Something's wrong with this line

528
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:36,880
Don't you put that dirty paper
on my windshield!

529
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:56,122
6:55...

530
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,084
they close the post office

531
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,636
6:58...
the subject has not reappeared

532
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:02,559
7:04... operation suspended

533
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,126
According to this...

534
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,723
the subject spent the night
in the post office!

535
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:09,486
You must be kidding!

536
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:12,559
I lost him

537
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:15,525
The magician
made himself disappear!

538
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:19,759
What kind of club does he work at?

539
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,562
Kind of an arty place...

540
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,957
with candles on the tables
and Vivaldi...

541
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:26,276
in the toilets

542
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:29,245
What statue are you referring to?

543
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:32,843
He makes all his appointments
at a statue of Joan of Arc

544
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,440
An equestrian statue?

545
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:37,606
Mr tabard is here

546
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:38,882
Show him in

547
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:41,601
I'm sure the magician spotted you

548
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:44,042
I'll have to put someone else on it

549
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:47,244
I don't know what to do with you.
You're certainly willing

550
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,325
But you discourage me

551
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:08,486
I may as well be frank

552
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,805
I have no special reason for coming

553
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,805
People don't usually
come here out of curiosity

554
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:22,438
Are you married?

555
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:25,280
Yes, very happily

556
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:28,325
To a superior woman

557
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:32,318
No problem there

558
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:34,559
I'm in good health

559
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,557
Delighted to hear it

560
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:38,995
Your profession?

561
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:42,557
Oh, the store is doing fine.
We double our profits every year

562
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:45,522
What store?

563
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:49,477
My shoe store

564
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:52,642
Shoes for men, women
and children...

565
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:54,206
especially children

566
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:55,966
Everybody needs shoes, right?

567
00:42:57,487 --> 00:43:00,559
And with traffic jams,
more people are walking

568
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:03,684
Then you're a happy man...

569
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,644
with no cares, no enemies

570
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:08,196
Not without enemies

571
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:12,318
Ever since my childhood,
in college and in the army...

572
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,478
people have been jealous of me

573
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:16,763
Not that it keeps me awake

574
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,363
And I have one failing...

575
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:22,123
I'm frank!

576
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:25,318
I see what you mean

577
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:29,005
But I don't understand
why you're here

578
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:31,645
What do you want from me?

579
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:37,555
Well, nobody loves me,
and I want to know why

580
00:43:38,527 --> 00:43:40,404
I know what you'll say...

581
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:42,360
I should see an analyst

582
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:46,722
It's not that I can't afford one.
But I can't waste time...

583
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:50,237
telling my life story on a couch!
I'm not a mamma's boy!

584
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:52,239
And my store keeps me busy

585
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:54,602
A bootier's work is never done!

586
00:43:57,887 --> 00:44:01,118
If you feel everyone hates you,
it may be...

587
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:03,239
that you look down on people

588
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,284
Oh no! Certainly not!

589
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:07,722
Anyone can buy shoes...

590
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:08,922
at Tabard's...

591
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:13,322
Jewish women, Arabs...

592
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:17,076
even Chinese women...

593
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:22,516
as long as they wear high heels,
of course

594
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,518
I feel that I'm despised

595
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:31,687
But I don't know by whom

596
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:36,002
I can sense it all around me...

597
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,596
in restaurants, at the movies...

598
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:40,325
at prize fights

599
00:44:41,327 --> 00:44:42,680
My concierge, for instance...

600
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,077
When I speak to her, she shrugs

601
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:47,643
And my wife laughs all the time...

602
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,923
except when I tell a joke

603
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,160
And my salesgirls...

604
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,078
They're the worst

605
00:44:56,247 --> 00:44:59,922
Whenever I comment
on their work...

606
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:01,960
they answer back...

607
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:05,195
they argue

608
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:07,726
Do you have any friends?

609
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:09,959
Not one

610
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,437
Luckily I don't need any.
If I did...

611
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:13,437
I couldn't make any

612
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:15,399
How many salesgirls have you?

613
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,924
Four, plus the cashier

614
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:23,806
We could start our investigation...
in your store

615
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:26,406
I could install a periscope

616
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,244
I'll show you

617
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:32,041
Send Doinel in

618
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:39,918
He said right away

619
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:41,800
This isn't my day!

620
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:44,481
You know what my father said...

621
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:47,002
when I left home?

622
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,520
"Be respectful... to your boss!"

623
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:53,480
Here's our periscope

624
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:09,155
He's young

625
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes. But brilliant

626
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,916
Send him in on Monday.
I'll hire him

627
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,203
Oh no! That wouldn't work

628
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:22,684
No one must suspect
you know each other

629
00:46:23,687 --> 00:46:26,201
Place an ad: "Stockboy wanted."

630
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,278
Start when I say go

631
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,676
1, 2, 3, go

632
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:11,439
Show me your packages

633
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:14,246
This one's fine

634
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:16,318
We'll hire him

635
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:41,122
How's everything?

636
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:44,605
Fine. I'm working in a shoe store

637
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:47,526
I'm fine too.
You know my T.V. Scripts...

638
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:49,837
I took them to the head men

639
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:51,963
They liked them. They're interested

640
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm sure they'll take them

641
00:47:55,527 --> 00:47:56,596
So I'm fine

642
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:16,038
Is there a restaurant around here?

643
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:17,959
Eat with us

644
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:23,446
Usually we all bring something

645
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:25,245
I don't want to bother you

646
00:48:25,407 --> 00:48:27,443
We'll manage

647
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:30,444
Help me set the table

648
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:38,325
Say, the boss, Mr Tabard...

649
00:48:39,007 --> 00:48:40,565
I like him

650
00:48:40,847 --> 00:48:42,724
You don't know him!
He's a dinosaur!

651
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:50,398
You're not going till you find
those "Louis XV" shoes

652
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:53,925
They never arrived.
They're not on my slips

653
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:56,999
Didn't you learn anything at school?

654
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:00,804
The factory confirms they fixed
the shanks and returned them

655
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:02,639
You signed the receipt

656
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:06,356
I signed lots of papers today.
I don't know where they are

657
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:09,405
The customer paid for those shoes!

658
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:13,126
I've looked
in all the unmarked boxes

659
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:16,165
Well, they're in the wrong box

660
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:20,518
Fan all the stacks
till you find them

661
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:23,360
I want those shoes
first thing tomorrow!

662
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:58,357
You shouldn't be here,
the store is closed

663
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:03,078
- If all the customers did that...
- they'd all be Fabienne Tabard

664
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:04,760
I'm the boss's wife

665
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:06,640
Oh, I apologize

666
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:10,958
It's all right.
You're the new boy?

667
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:21,165
What do you think of these?

668
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:25,123
Too shiny for the dress.
You're right

669
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:28,521
Go get me a pair like these...

670
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,160
with black satin toes. Size 41/2

671
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,246
Mr Tabard is impatient, as usual

672
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:00,639
Will you answer it?

673
00:52:08,687 --> 00:52:11,247
I don't understand

674
00:52:15,447 --> 00:52:17,642
It's in English

675
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:42,956
Would you mind taking this up
to the apartment?

676
00:52:47,127 --> 00:52:48,640
Do you know how to lock up?

677
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:52,038
You work awfully late

678
00:53:08,327 --> 00:53:09,043
On the Cinderella case...

679
00:53:09,527 --> 00:53:12,200
The employees call Mr Tabard
"the dinosaur"

680
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:15,119
I met Mrs Tabard

681
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:17,721
Her voice is enchanting
and she speaks English

682
00:53:17,887 --> 00:53:19,400
Describe her

683
00:53:20,287 --> 00:53:21,686
She's superb!

684
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,356
A little vague and very gentle

685
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:28,159
She has an adorable
turned-up nose

686
00:53:28,687 --> 00:53:29,563
Hersize?

687
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:31,043
Slender

688
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,925
I mean how tall is she?

689
00:53:34,767 --> 00:53:36,246
5ft.5 without heels

690
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:37,806
What shape face?

691
00:53:38,327 --> 00:53:40,158
A pure oval...

692
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:42,363
slightly triangular

693
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,721
Luminous skin...

694
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,081
lit up from within

695
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:47,562
We want a report,
not a declaration oflove!

696
00:55:06,047 --> 00:55:09,323
What do you mean,
hounding me at the store?

697
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:11,955
Well, you never call,
and you're never home

698
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,924
My parents were worried about you

699
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:17,602
Tell them hello for me

700
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:20,237
There's no reason to be so nasty

701
00:55:20,407 --> 00:55:22,204
No reason, huh?

702
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,278
If I did anything, just tell me

703
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:26,324
Oh, nothing at all!

704
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:28,079
I thought I was your friend

705
00:55:28,247 --> 00:55:31,398
You can keep your friendship!

706
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:32,966
So we're back to last year

707
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:36,005
No! Much farther back.
And whose fault is it?

708
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,364
Not mine! I can't remember
all your letters...

709
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,518
but you once wrote...

710
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:46,278
Now I know I feel nothing
but friendship foryou

711
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:49,484
- Did you write that, or not?
- That's what I thought, then

712
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:52,400
But love and friendship
call for admiration

713
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:54,523
Well, I don't admire you!

714
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:57,600
Even when I thought I loved you
I didn't admire you

715
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:15,240
I don't want to go alone

716
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:17,284
Get Antoine to take you

717
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:19,878
I wouldn't mind.
I've got a real yen for him

718
00:56:20,407 --> 00:56:22,875
But he's crazy about Mrs Tabard!

719
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,919
The other day Sylvie
called her "Mrs Dinosaur"

720
00:56:28,087 --> 00:56:31,966
Antoine was furious! He said,
"She's an exceptional woman!"

721
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:35,485
Then he said, "She is not a woman.
She's an apparition!"

722
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:39,445
Haven't you noticed?

723
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:42,315
When she appears
he turns white as a sheet

724
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:21,280
No, not that stack.
Look in the green boxes on top

725
00:58:21,927 --> 00:58:23,246
They're empty

726
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:25,284
Higher

727
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:33,679
Do I have tomorrow off?

728
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:35,396
No

729
00:58:35,927 --> 00:58:36,962
Can I leave early today?

730
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:38,003
No

731
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:39,163
Do you want to hear a story?

732
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:41,322
No

733
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:44,520
The one about the moron
who said no... Well, it's you!

734
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:51,566
Come with me

735
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:55,322
It's like that all the time

736
00:58:55,607 --> 00:58:57,563
How's your investigation going?

737
00:58:57,727 --> 00:59:00,082
I can't say.
I make my report every night

738
00:59:00,247 --> 00:59:03,000
Mr Blady analyzes them.
If you want more details...

739
00:59:14,447 --> 00:59:17,803
Who gives the biggest checks
to the Shoe Defense Fund?

740
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:19,366
Yours truly

741
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:23,085
You're late, George.
Everything's cold

742
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:26,557
It doesn't matter.
I'll just have some cheese

743
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:29,362
The girls get the boxes mixed up

744
00:59:32,047 --> 00:59:34,277
I'll give the accounts to Antoine

745
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,160
- Have you had lunch?
- Yes. Downstairs

746
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:39,245
With the girls?

747
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:42,081
There's one book missing. Sit down

748
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:44,358
I'll give it to you later

749
00:59:55,207 --> 00:59:56,720
Do you like cheese?

750
00:59:58,087 --> 01:00:00,362
This one's perfect.
It stinks beautifully!

751
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:02,924
I'd rather have a yogurt

752
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:13,641
Dick and Janet called

753
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:16,321
I told them to call the store

754
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,883
They're taking
their first French lesson

755
01:00:22,207 --> 01:00:22,957
Do you speak English?

756
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:28,924
I'm studying... with records

757
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:31,759
Records are a joke!

758
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:35,205
You can only learn English in bed...

759
01:00:35,487 --> 01:00:38,604
with an English girl

760
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:42,444
I learned with an Australian

761
01:00:43,847 --> 01:00:45,803
Her husband was a house painter

762
01:00:47,847 --> 01:00:49,121
Like Hitler

763
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,999
Don't ever say that!

764
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:55,316
It's slander

765
01:00:56,327 --> 01:00:58,443
Hitler was a landscape painter

766
01:01:14,207 --> 01:01:17,961
The one I need is in the car.
Wait for me, Antoine

767
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:20,959
I'll do it

768
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:29,966
Are you coming?

769
01:02:51,687 --> 01:02:53,723
Do you like music?

770
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:54,638
Yes, sir

771
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:23,839
What's wrong, Antoine?

772
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:28,517
I'm sick!

773
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:35,239
I'm going home

774
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:46,958
Where's the new boy, Antoine?

775
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,357
He went home, sick

776
01:03:58,647 --> 01:04:00,763
May I see the book, please

777
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:05,757
No, the personnel record

778
01:04:36,727 --> 01:04:39,036
Give me a word to use
in place of "say"

779
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:42,518
I've used it 10 times already

780
01:04:42,687 --> 01:04:46,362
Confide, state, relate, affirm...

781
01:04:46,647 --> 01:04:48,365
You sure know a lot

782
01:04:48,607 --> 01:04:50,677
But I'll stick to "say"

783
01:04:55,447 --> 01:04:58,120
Mrs Tabard really keeps me
on the run

784
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:01,242
But I've got a clue

785
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:02,516
She has a lover

786
01:05:02,687 --> 01:05:04,996
She does not! She's above all that!

787
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:08,796
I saw her buying 3 ties at Cardin's.
Tabard doesn't wear them

788
01:05:09,007 --> 01:05:11,202
That's right. He wears bow ties

789
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:15,562
I'm going to ask Mr Blady
to put me on another case!

790
01:05:21,527 --> 01:05:23,722
I must talk to you

791
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:27,880
Not now. Mr Albany is here

792
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:31,159
Can't you wait 5 minutes?

793
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,283
No, it's urgent!

794
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,122
I'll see you in a little while

795
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:51,763
We've been lucky in your case...
we aren't always

796
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:55,000
We shadowed your friend...

797
01:05:55,727 --> 01:05:57,126
the magician

798
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,398
Robert Espanet, 35

799
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:03,637
He's been doing his act...

800
01:06:03,847 --> 01:06:06,680
at the Golden Horse
since last September

801
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:09,642
His address is...

802
01:06:09,807 --> 01:06:11,718
42 rue de la RÈpublique

803
01:06:16,327 --> 01:06:18,887
He moved
because his wife was pregnant

804
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:20,362
His wife!

805
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:24,000
He was married on Nov 12th

806
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,963
You must be mistaken!

807
01:06:27,127 --> 01:06:29,118
No. The marriage contract...

808
01:06:29,287 --> 01:06:31,403
was drawn up by Lebaudet

809
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,323
You're a dirty liar!

810
01:06:36,727 --> 01:06:38,638
Give me that!

811
01:07:01,447 --> 01:07:04,280
Go get the dentist upstairs!

812
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,757
There's a crazy guy in our office!

813
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:32,406
Take him home

814
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:36,446
No, I can't face it.
He left all his things there!

815
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:38,155
You have to go somewhere

816
01:07:38,327 --> 01:07:40,079
I'll go to a hotel

817
01:07:40,247 --> 01:07:42,477
Put him in a cab and take him home

818
01:07:42,647 --> 01:07:45,081
You must be real proud of yourself

819
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:51,517
I hope he paid in advance

820
01:08:20,247 --> 01:08:22,807
One ofmy teachers
once explained the difference

821
01:08:22,967 --> 01:08:24,798
between tact andpoliteness

822
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,845
A man opens a bathroom door
by mistake

823
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:29,918
and sees a naked lady

824
01:08:30,087 --> 01:08:32,237
He steps back and says

825
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:34,921
"Excuse me, madam."
That's politeness

826
01:08:35,087 --> 01:08:39,160
the same man finds
the same naked lady and says

827
01:08:39,327 --> 01:08:41,921
"Excuse me, sir." that's tact!

828
01:08:42,087 --> 01:08:45,363
I know why you ran away,
Antoine... until tomorrow...

829
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:54,402
For the past hour...

830
01:08:56,287 --> 01:08:58,562
I've been looking at the ties...

831
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:01,923
which I would never dare to wear

832
01:09:09,047 --> 01:09:10,924
this is a farewell letter

833
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:14,724
You are generous,
and I don't deserve yourgenerosity

834
01:09:14,887 --> 01:09:18,357
You will neversee me again.
I'm quitting myjob

835
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:22,480
I'm an impostor ofthe worst kind

836
01:09:22,887 --> 01:09:25,879
I dreamed that a feeling
might exist between us

837
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:29,005
But that is as impossible
as Felix's love...

838
01:09:29,407 --> 01:09:30,999
forMme de Mortsauf

839
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:33,602
Farewell

840
01:11:02,207 --> 01:11:03,435
I woke you up

841
01:11:05,407 --> 01:11:07,523
I was awakened very early too...

842
01:11:07,687 --> 01:11:09,678
by your letter

843
01:11:11,527 --> 01:11:14,599
but it doesn't matter.
It's a pleasure...

844
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:17,640
to wake up
and read something lovely

845
01:11:19,287 --> 01:11:22,085
I sat down to answer it

846
01:11:23,007 --> 01:11:24,679
But I realized...

847
01:11:26,007 --> 01:11:28,601
that I had to come here
right away, myself

848
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:34,921
I've read the Lily in the Valley

849
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,641
I'm like you. I think it's beautiful

850
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:46,682
But you forgot one thing

851
01:11:49,607 --> 01:11:53,202
Although Mme de Mortsauf
loved Felix...

852
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:56,280
it is not a beautiful love story

853
01:11:57,767 --> 01:11:59,405
It's terribly sad...

854
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:01,683
for she died...

855
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:05,726
because she couldn't share
her love with him

856
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:14,160
Besides, I'm not an apparition.
I'm a woman...

857
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:17,202
which is the opposite

858
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:20,487
For example,
this morning before I came...

859
01:12:21,327 --> 01:12:22,885
I put some make-up on

860
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,003
I powdered my nose

861
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:28,802
I made up my eyes

862
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,957
And as I came across Paris
I noticed...

863
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:36,958
that all the women
had done the same thing...

864
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:39,807
for their pleasure,
or that of others

865
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:43,003
You say that I'm exceptional

866
01:12:43,687 --> 01:12:45,996
It's true. I am exceptional

867
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:49,523
Every woman is exceptional in turn

868
01:12:50,007 --> 01:12:50,803
You, over there...

869
01:12:51,887 --> 01:12:53,798
you're exceptional too

870
01:12:54,247 --> 01:12:57,080
Your fingerprints are unique

871
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:58,646
You are unique

872
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,763
We're both unique...

873
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,724
and irreplaceable

874
01:13:04,687 --> 01:13:06,518
Before he died...

875
01:13:06,687 --> 01:13:09,281
my father beckoned to the doctor...

876
01:13:10,447 --> 01:13:11,675
and said

877
01:13:13,647 --> 01:13:15,478
"People are wonderful!"

878
01:13:16,007 --> 01:13:17,486
Then he died

879
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:23,236
You don't need to talk

880
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:25,637
But I wish you'd look at me

881
01:13:28,927 --> 01:13:32,124
You wrote me yesterday.
And the answer is...

882
01:13:33,687 --> 01:13:34,756
me

883
01:13:39,527 --> 01:13:41,199
I propose...

884
01:13:41,767 --> 01:13:43,086
a contract...

885
01:13:44,727 --> 01:13:47,195
which is fair to both of us

886
01:13:49,327 --> 01:13:52,285
Since we both like
what is exceptional...

887
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:57,161
I'll come close to you...

888
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,316
now

889
01:14:00,047 --> 01:14:02,720
We'll spend a few hours together

890
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:08,443
And then, whatever happens,
we'll never meet again

891
01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:10,961
Do you agree?

892
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:19,004
I'll take the key out of the lock

893
01:14:29,207 --> 01:14:30,959
In the stories we both like...

894
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:33,721
the lady throws the key
out the window

895
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:37,281
But this vase will do very well

896
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,876
Surprise! This morning...

897
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:25,322
Mrs Tabard, who never gets up
before 11...

898
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,796
went out at 8:15

899
01:15:28,047 --> 01:15:30,925
I followed her
to 18 Square d'Anvers...

900
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,200
where she stayed
an hour and a half

901
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:35,920
Then she went home

902
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:38,478
Whose apartment did she go to?

903
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:41,480
I don't know.
There are a lot of apartments

904
01:15:41,647 --> 01:15:44,878
The concierge wasn't there,
but I'll go back

905
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:48,756
I know where she was

906
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:57,806
I have to see you alone

907
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:13,319
I hate to bother you

908
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:15,284
I'm the high school principal

909
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:20,365
I need some information...

910
01:16:20,647 --> 01:16:24,242
about one of your teachers,
Miss Dupuis

911
01:16:26,847 --> 01:16:28,963
Oh, nothing important...

912
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:33,757
just some details about her life...
her morals...

913
01:16:38,247 --> 01:16:40,044
I'm on a new case

914
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:45,722
What am I going to tell Mr Tabard?
That he paid 2000 Frs for that!

915
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:47,685
Is it real hair?

916
01:16:50,927 --> 01:16:52,360
Not bad, huh?

917
01:16:58,007 --> 01:16:59,838
I'll call Mr Blady

918
01:17:15,087 --> 01:17:17,555
Hang up. Mr Henri is dead

919
01:18:14,687 --> 01:18:16,917
For a little more I'll strip

920
01:18:18,767 --> 01:18:20,917
Here. But keep your clothes on

921
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:23,157
You can stay longer then

922
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:24,885
I don't want to

923
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:48,556
That jerk!

924
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:49,961
Put your brakes on!

925
01:18:52,287 --> 01:18:54,517
What are you doing now?

926
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:57,515
I'm a T.V. Repair man

927
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:02,039
No, no... It was my fault

928
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:07,243
I can think of better ways
to find you

929
01:19:07,407 --> 01:19:08,726
But no harm done

930
01:19:26,047 --> 01:19:28,117
Have a nice weekend

931
01:19:28,287 --> 01:19:29,959
Don't you want to come with us?

932
01:19:30,127 --> 01:19:31,799
No, I have to study

933
01:19:32,527 --> 01:19:34,040
You can always call Lucienne

934
01:19:34,207 --> 01:19:36,118
I won't be lonesome. I'll watch T.V.

935
01:19:37,087 --> 01:19:39,681
Don't stay inside all weekend

936
01:20:05,687 --> 01:20:07,803
SOS 9999

937
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:12,476
Could you come
to 44 Ave Edouard Vaillant?

938
01:20:13,127 --> 01:20:15,243
The T.V. Doesn't work at all

939
01:21:14,407 --> 01:21:16,284
Oh, it's a Serene Voice!

940
01:21:21,247 --> 01:21:23,397
Who took this out?

941
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:25,759
That's funny. It's like in a cab

942
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:28,361
Please! Let me work in peace!

943
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:37,598
That's not the way to do it!

944
01:22:38,007 --> 01:22:39,838
I'll teach you something

945
01:22:40,007 --> 01:22:42,077
How to butter it without breaking it

946
01:22:42,247 --> 01:22:44,807
You take two pieces, like this

947
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:47,564
You spread the butter

948
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:51,084
And the top one will never break

949
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:54,797
I'll teach you everything I know

950
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:57,401
And you'll teach me what you know

951
01:23:03,727 --> 01:23:05,683
It's not very important...

952
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:07,360
Yes, it is...

953
01:23:08,407 --> 01:23:11,001
but I'd rather write it down

954
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:13,919
Have you got a pencil?

955
01:24:39,687 --> 01:24:42,645
I forgot my handkerchief.
Will you lend me yours?

956
01:24:42,847 --> 01:24:44,166
All I've got is kleenex

957
01:24:44,487 --> 01:24:45,840
No thanks. I never use paper!

958
01:24:46,687 --> 01:24:48,598
Don't look now...
There's a strange guy

959
01:24:49,207 --> 01:24:51,516
I think he's been following me

960
01:24:52,727 --> 01:24:53,716
Who is he?

961
01:24:53,887 --> 01:24:55,764
I don't know. Here he comes

962
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:08,517
I know I'm not unknown to you

963
01:25:09,047 --> 01:25:11,436
For a long time
I watched you in secret

964
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:14,157
But now I've stopped hiding

965
01:25:14,967 --> 01:25:17,117
I know that the time has come

966
01:25:19,687 --> 01:25:22,485
Before you, I'd never been in love

967
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:24,558
I hate the temporary

968
01:25:24,767 --> 01:25:26,280
I know all about life

969
01:25:26,447 --> 01:25:29,041
I know that everyone
betrays everyone

970
01:25:29,887 --> 01:25:31,764
But you and I will be different

971
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:34,964
We'll never leave each other,
not for a single hour

972
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:39,400
I have no work.
I have no obligations in life

973
01:25:40,447 --> 01:25:42,597
You will be my sole preoccupation

974
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:44,966
I understand...

975
01:25:45,127 --> 01:25:47,436
I realize this is all too sudden...

976
01:25:47,607 --> 01:25:51,236
for you to say yes at once...
that you must first separate...

977
01:25:51,687 --> 01:25:54,281
from some temporary people

978
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:57,439
I am definitive

979
01:26:03,727 --> 01:26:05,285
I am very happy

980
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:11,358
The man's really mad!

981
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:14,719
He must be

982
01:26:57,047 --> 01:26:59,242

Doinel, bring me that.

4
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,076
Nice. Go stand in the corner.

5
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,793
You've got one minute left.

6
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,062
Silence!

7
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,483
Papers will be collected in 30 seconds.

8
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,235
Quiet!

9
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,144
Row leaders, get ready.

10
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,975
I'll count to three.

11
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,887
One.

12
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,105
Two.

13
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,450
Three. Collect the papers.

14
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,377
Get the others first.

15
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,922
- Give it to me.
- Just a second.

16
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,132
- What's going on?
- He won't turn it in.

17
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,468
No special treatment!

18
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,553
Brownnose.

19
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,307
Do I have everyone's paper?

20
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,826
You may go.

21
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,355
Not you, my friend!

22
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,234
Recess is a reward, not a right.

23
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,274
<i>Here poor Antoine Doinel was
unfairly punished by Sourpuss</i>

24
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,360
<i>for a pinup that fell from the sky.</i>

25
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,613
<i>It will be an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.</i>

26
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,867
Hey, champs, maybe you need
a referee over here.

27
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,663
No recess for three days.
That'll teach you.

28
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,052
Look at this!

29
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,555
What's so interesting there?

30
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,999
Take your seats!

31
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,446
We have a young Juvenal in our class,

32
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,824
though he doesn't know an Alexandrine
from blank verse.

33
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,702
Doinel, for tomorrow
you will conjugate-

34
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,497
Take your seat and write this down.

35
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,126
In all tenses of the indicative,
conditional and subjunctive-

36
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,046
The rest of you,
get out your notebooks.

37
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,293
"I deface the classroom walls...

38
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,933
and abuse French verse."

39
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,987
"The Hare"!

40
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,200
Doinel, go get something
to wipe that rubbish off the wall,

41
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,869
or I'll make you lick it off!

42
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,460
Richer, who said
you could change seats?

43
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,765
"In the season when the thickets

44
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:03,482
Glow with crimson flowers

45
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,656
When the black tip

46
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,002
Of my long ears

47
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,339
Could already be seen

48
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,344
Above

49
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,017
The still-green rye

50
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,526
From which I nibbled

51
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,365
The tender stems

52
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,914
As I frolicked about

53
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,673
One day

54
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,221
Fatigued

55
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,603
I was fast asleep

56
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,024
In my hutch

57
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,861
When little Margot surprised me there"

58
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,618
- I saw you, Simonot!
- I didn't do anything, sir.

59
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,245
It's always someone else.

60
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,582
"She loved me so

61
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,294
My beautiful little mistress

62
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,307
What kindness she showed me

63
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,394
How caring and tender

64
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,023
How she hugged me on her little lap

65
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,484
And kissed me"

66
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,237
Who's the idiot who whistled?

67
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,991
I warn you, speak up
or your neighbor will get it.

68
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,577
- You hear me, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir.

69
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,080
And cowards to boot!

70
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,957
What a class this year!

71
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,128
I've known idiots before,
but at least they were polite!

72
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,547
They kept their heads down
and didn't get caught.

73
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,884
And you- you call that clean?
You made it filthier!

74
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,762
Go to your seat and copy this down.
Your parents will pay the price.

75
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:42,349
Poor France will be in sorry shape
in ten years!

76
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,277
- Everyone swipes money from their parents.
- Maybe, but it isn't easy.

77
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,112
I bet even Mauricet does it.

78
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,656
Hey, Mauricet,
we want to ask you something.

79
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,076
- Where'd you get those fancy glasses?
- I bought them.

80
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,787
Did you pinch the money
from your mom or your dad?

81
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,583
Don't pretend you don't go
through their pockets.

82
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,503
You're the louse
who squealed on me today!

83
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,340
You're a louse, Mauricet!

84
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,758
Your days are numbered.

85
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,551
You'll get yours!

86
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,973
I'll never finish my homework tonight.

87
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,694
- Sourpuss is a real asshole.
- That's his job.

88
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:40,240
Still, I'm gonna smash his face in
before I go to the army!

89
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,035
See you.

90
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,787
"I deface the classroom walls."

91
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,095
- Evening, Mother.
- Evening.

92
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,564
- Where's the flour?
- What flour?

93
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,026
Didn't you buy what I told you to?

94
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,447
- Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it.

95
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,449
No wonder you get such bad grades.

96
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,660
Go get my slippers.

97
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,957
In the bedroom, under the bed.

98
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,550
I need that flour.
Go get it right away.

99
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,655
They had to use forceps.

100
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,449
Seems it runs in the family.
Same thing happened to her mother.

101
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,745
That means nothing.
With Fanny it was over in ten minutes.

102
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,499
But if they hadn't done a caesarian
for the last one,

103
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,543
I wouldn't be talking to you now.

104
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,337
And my sister, with one every year.
Can you imagine?

105
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,424
The doctor warned her.

106
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:30,762
She had to have surgery.
There was blood everywhere.

107
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,309
- Always running, eh, son?
- I got bawled out 'cause of this flour.

108
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,394
- Always running, eh, son?
- I got bawled out 'cause of this flour.

109
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:42,316
You mustn't make your mother mad.
You have to handle her gently.

110
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,028
- What's that?
- A fog light.

111
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,697
I'm gonna try it out
at the race on Sunday.

112
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,045
- Look at your little flour boy here.
- That's not funny!

113
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,964
I thought it was.

114
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,885
- Where's my change?
- I need it for lunch at school.

115
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,511
Ask your father.

116
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,138
Let's have it!

117
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,394
I sense a storm coming.

118
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,396
- Dad, I need some money-
- What?

119
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,232
I just need 1,000 francs.

120
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,361
Which means you're hoping for 500,
meaning you really need 300,

121
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,072
so here's a hundred.

122
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,117
All right, 500.
But your mother should pay for that.

123
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,661
Where are the scissors?

124
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,704
Where are the scissors

125
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,415
Stop playing the clown.
And what are you laughing about?

126
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,419
This is no time for homework.
We're about to eat.

127
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,590
She's right. There's a time
and a place for everything.

128
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,636
Where'd you get this pen?

129
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,055
I traded for it.

130
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,808
You've been doing
a lot of trading lately.

131
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,691
What's that? Do you smell it?

132
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,486
- It's fish.
- Smells promising.

133
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,616
Ask your mother
if the dishtowel's on fire.

134
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,368
Why?

135
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,537
For a laugh.

136
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,098
You can clear the table, son.

137
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,475
Your cousin called.

138
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,770
- His wife's expecting again.
- Four kids in three years?

139
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,981
Like rabbits. It's disgusting.

140
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,651
Speaking of kids, what'll we do
with this one for the summer?

141
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,155
- Summer camp ain't for poodles.
- And he'd be with others his age.

142
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,325
- We don't have to decide yet.
- The sooner, the better.

143
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,122
Don't pull too hard.

144
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,168
- Nice, huh?
- "Lions Club."

145
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,838
- What's going on here?
- Hey, careful.

146
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:14,050
Where would you like
to drive this Sunday?

147
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,886
The club asked me to plan the route.

148
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,388
- I want to rest on Sunday.
- Where?

149
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,559
- At my girlfriend's.
- What'll the guys think?

150
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,478
Listen, I've had enough.

151
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,189
- Housework all morning and-
- And the "touch" system all afternoon.

152
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,525
- What?
- Your typewriter or someone else's.

153
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,861
Antoine, time for bed now.

154
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,491
'Night, Dad. 'Night, Mother.

155
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,284
You're such an idiot sometimes.

156
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,871
You've got no sense of humor.

157
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,415
You're wasting your time on that crap.

158
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,794
Don't forget the garbage,
and turn your light out.

159
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,548
I make contacts at the races.
You'll see. I'll be VP one day.

160
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:58,470
You'll never be VP. They like you
puttering along where you are.

161
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:08,021
<i>Our evening programming has ended.
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

162
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,100
Get up, quick.
We didn't hear the alarm.

163
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,745
<i>"I deface the classroom walls."</i>

164
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,668
There's no sock left
around all these holes.

165
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,421
Those have had it.
Buy some new ones.

166
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,464
All your others are dirty.

167
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,802
I gave you money to buy sheets
for the boy's bed, remember?

168
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:25,473
He prefers his sleeping bag.
Right, son?

169
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,268
Sure, it keeps me warm.

170
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,645
You're still here?

171
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,064
See you.

172
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,530
- No need to run.
- We're gonna be late.

173
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,783
We'll have to sneak in
and we'll get in trouble.

174
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,578
- Take it easy.
- Why?

175
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,581
Sourpuss said he wouldn't
let you back in.

176
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,917
- You think he'll do it?
- Yeah. He can't stand you.

177
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,544
- Got any money?
- Lunch money.

178
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,922
Then just follow me.

179
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,132
What are you up to?

180
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,905
Follow me.

181
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,784
- Put your bag behind the door.
- Will they be safe there?

182
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,953
I leave mine here all the time.

183
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,930
My God, it's Antoine!
I'm sure he saw me.

184
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,557
Which one is yours?

185
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,518
The dark-haired one.
What's he doing out of school?

186
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,688
- You're really gonna get it tonight!
- She wouldn't dare tell my father.

187
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,149
- Wasn't that him?
- Never saw the guy before.

188
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,735
Then you're safe.

189
00:25:56,055 --> 00:26:00,266
I'm going back to school tomorrow,
but I'll need a note.

190
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,229
- What are you gonna do?
- I have an old one I never used.

191
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,942
I'll cut off the date.
Here, you can copy it tonight.

192
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,403
- What about the handwriting?
- Copy your mother's.

193
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,198
That'll be hard.
She writes really funny.

194
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,200
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

195
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,953
I hope so. See you.

196
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,831
"Dear Sir,

197
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,213
Please excuse

198
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,221
my son RenÈ

199
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,477
who was sick-"

200
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,980
My son RenÈ!

201
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,000
Hi, Dad.

202
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:12,422
- Something burning in here again?
- It's from downstairs.

203
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,134
- Set the table for two tonight.
- Has Mother left?

204
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,554
No, she called to say
she'd be home late.

205
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,390
Her boss needs her
for year-end inventory.

206
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,645
You and I will have ourselves
a real bachelors' dinner.

207
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,150
- She said there are eggs around.
- I know where.

208
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,367
- Did you work hard today?
- Yes.

209
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,329
- What did you study?
- "The Hare."

210
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,748
Ah, "The Tortoise and the Hare."

211
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,292
No, just "The Hare."

212
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,338
- Did you do well?
- I wasn't called on.

213
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,424
You have to raise your hand
and get noticed,

214
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,760
or you'll never get in the race.

215
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,529
You have to take initiative in life.

216
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,892
By the way, have you thought
about your mother's birthday?

217
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:10,438
It's the 17th.
I trust you'll get her something.

218
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,167
Are you listening?

219
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,986
I know what you're thinking:

220
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,073
She's been hard on you lately.

221
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,909
But she's under a lot of pressure.

222
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,370
Put yourself in her place.

223
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,749
Keeping house and working part-time,

224
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,335
and this place as cramped as it is.

225
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:36,130
I'm working on finding us
a different place.

226
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:44,180
Women are always taken
advantage of at the office,

227
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,557
and they don't know
what to do about it.

228
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,103
But she really loves you, you know.
Shit!

229
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,492
- Where's my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it.

230
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,745
You know I won't tolerate lying!

231
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,038
It's the truth.

232
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,916
I know I put it away yesterday.

233
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,960
It wasn't me.

234
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,463
Things vanish into thin air
around here!

235
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,341
It wasn't me.

236
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,597
All right. I'll ask your mother.

237
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,603
Time for bed now.

238
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,606
Don't forget the garbage.

239
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,707
- My boss drove me home.
- Your boss!

240
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:39,504
- I couldn't very well refuse, could I?
- I hope you get overtime for that!

241
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,380
I will, at the end of the month.

242
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,341
Those services are usually paid in cash!

243
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,259
Oh, knock it off!

244
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,095
No wonder madame needs
to rest on Sunday.

245
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:52,183
- By the way, where's my Michelin guide?
- How should I know? Ask the boy.

246
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,852
- He said he didn't touch it.
- He lies through his teeth.

247
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,355
- Like someone else I know.
- If you raised him better-

248
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,690
I gave him my name, damn it!
I put food on the table!

249
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:04,070
I've had enough of your criticism!

250
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,698
Fine! We'll send him to the Jesuits
or the army orphans.

251
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,951
At least I'd have some peace and quiet!

252
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,514
You two better eat out
till the end of the month.

253
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,183
For that I need a clean shirt!

254
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,978
If you can't wash the shirt,
at least wash the collar!

255
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,981
You shouldn't have bought
that fog light.

256
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,567
I bought it second-hand.

257
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,199
Go ahead. Open it.

258
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,743
What if it's the gas man?

259
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,079
They give you advance notice.

260
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,504
Morning, sir. I came to see
if Antoine's better today.

261
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:08,259
- Better? Why?
- He missed school yesterday.

262
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,678
You hear that?

263
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,099
- Thanks, kid.
- Good-bye, sir.

264
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,191
You don't seem surprised.

265
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,277
Should I be?

266
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,779
Nothing that boy does surprises me.

267
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,120
- I've gotta come up with an excuse.
- The bigger, the better.

268
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,498
When my mom broke her leg,
I told them the whole story,

269
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,001
except that she was drunk.
I didn't need a note.

270
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,046
Well, I can't use the same story.

271
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,048
And we can't show up together.

272
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,883
Right. You go first.

273
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,993
There you are.

274
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,497
A little extra homework
and you get sick, eh?

275
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,582
And your parents fall for it.

276
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,877
Can't wait to see what excuse
you wrangled out of them this time.

277
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,295
Let me see your note.

278
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,589
- I don't have one.
- Don't have one?

279
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,259
You think that's how it works?
It's not that easy, my friend!

280
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,682
- It was... my mother...
- What about her?

281
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,725
She's dead!

282
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,686
Oh, my gosh.

283
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,356
Sorry, son. I didn't know.

284
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,901
- Was she ill?
- Yes, sir.

285
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:53,239
You should've told me.
You should always confide in your teachers.

286
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,701
Go on now. Get in line.

287
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,464
- What excuse did you give him?
- Leave me alone!

288
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:24,895
- "Better thorns in the woods than..."
- Than up your-

289
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,983
If you'd wash your ears out, you'd hear
what your classmate is whispering.

290
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,526
Than up your ass.

291
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,904
- He's just trying to confuse me.
- All right, go on.

292
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,241
Now I've lost my place.

293
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,828
"Than flowers in the manger."

294
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,622
"Than flowers in the manger.
Better to have freedom..."

295
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,834
"And constant threat..."

296
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,253
"Than slavery..."

297
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,427
"In eternal April." And you're
an eternal loafer! You get an F.

298
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,304
I knew it at home.

299
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,389
Doinel?

300
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,016
Never mind, son.

301
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,684
Simonot.

302
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,102
"The Hare,"

303
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,449
by Jean Richepin.

304
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,620
Sit down, boys.

305
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,650
I suggest the punishment
should be in proportion-

306
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,237
He's exceeded
all proportion this time.

307
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,239
Only his parents can
be severe enough now.

308
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,783
We'll discuss this tonight!

309
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,084
What are you gonna do?

310
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:14,255
I can't live with my parents now
after what's happened.

311
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,590
I have to disappear.

312
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,551
Oh, I've done worse than this.

313
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,846
But I'm fed up.
I have to get out on my own.

314
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,265
I'll write them a letter.

315
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,350
- Just like that?
- Yes, it's for the best.

316
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,521
- Where will you sleep tonight?
- I don't know. I don't really care.

317
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,690
I've got an idea.

318
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,569
- Meet me in an hour at Place Pigalle.
- Okay.

319
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,719
It's my uncle's old printing plant.

320
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,221
The machines were so heavy,
the floor caved in.

321
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,307
Think it might cave in some more?

322
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,315
No, it already hit bottom.
You'll be warm here.

323
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,915
Here's your mattress,
and this'll be your pillow.

324
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,251
Damn, it's heavy!

325
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,173
You can just walk around
until midnight.

326
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,428
Keep my briefcase for me.
Give it back to me tomorrow.

327
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,221
Sure.

328
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,353
"Dear Mother and Dad, I understand-"
Misspelled, of course.

329
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,271
"how wrong it was to lie-"

330
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,024
I'll bet he does.
And why kill me off instead of you?

331
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,984
Personal preference, obviously.

332
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,112
"We can't go on living together."

333
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,782
"Therefore I'll try my luck alone
in Paris or elsewhere."

334
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,951
"I'll prove I can become a man."

335
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,245
"One day I'll come back
and we'll discuss all that's happened."

336
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,748
"Love, Antoine."

337
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,042
So you think it's normal
for him to hate me?

338
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,462
- You've been so hard on him.
- He gets on my nerves.

339
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,822
- Can you help me catch him?
- Of course, ma'am.

340
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,785
- Is that your sister?
- Never seen her before.

341
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,621
- Is the dog hers?
- I don't know.

342
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,336
- May I help?
- Certainly. The more, the better.

343
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,672
- What's his name?
- I have no idea.

344
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:07,177
- Beat it, kid.
- She asked me first!

345
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,221
You heard me!

346
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,310
MERRY CHRISTMAS

347
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,076
Doinel, I bet you got it last night.

348
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:21,038
Not at all. Everything was fine.

349
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,956
Go on now.

350
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,751
Parents spoil these kids rotten.

351
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,796
Need some help over there?

352
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,969
The last question,

353
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,180
even easier this time.

354
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,527
Tip of the tongue between your teeth,
as if you had a lisp.

355
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,618
I can't do it, sir. Not everyone
can make their tongue do that.

356
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,328
Silence!

357
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,790
Go sit down.

358
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,751
Insolent!

359
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,964
Abbou.

360
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,424
Answer this question.

361
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,996
Be seated.

362
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,457
Frochot, you're in charge till I return.

363
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,050
We don't know
what to do with him anymore.

364
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,345
My dear lady, you deserve better.

365
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,516
My poor darling! Are you all right?

366
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,311
- Where did you spend the night?
- In a printing plant.

367
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,065
I don't care if he's last in his class.
I just want him to behave.

368
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,942
Then we're agreed.

369
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,323
Maybe it's something in his glands.

370
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,840
You mustn't catch cold.

371
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,302
There! Now off to bed.

372
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,180
I'm not tired, Mother.

373
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,809
You'll be more comfortable in our bed.

374
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:03,075
I was your age once too, you know.
You kids always forget that.

375
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,036
I was stubborn too and didn't want
to confide in my parents.

376
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,413
I preferred writing in my diary.

377
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,876
No one's ever read it.
I'll show it to you one day.

378
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,837
Once when I was your age,
we were on vacation,

379
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,799
and I ran away
with a young farm boy.

380
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,675
Puppy love.
They caught us right away.

381
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,053
Mother made me promise
never to see him again.

382
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,138
She never told my father.

383
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,099
I cried and cried, but I obeyed her,

384
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,018
because you should always obey
your mother.

385
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,771
You and I can share
some little secrets.

386
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,732
Tell me, what did you mean
in your letter when you said:

387
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,193
"We'll discuss all that's happened?"

388
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:43,073
My misbehaving, and my bad grades.

389
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,158
So talk to me now.

390
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,411
I just can't concentrate.

391
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,205
I want to quit school
and earn a living.

392
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,583
That's nonsense!
Don't you understand?

393
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,586
If you knew how sorry I am
I stopped after high school!

394
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,339
And your father never even finished!

395
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,883
It's hurting his career now.

396
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,137
I know they teach you
a lot of useless stuff in school.

397
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,722
Algebra... science.

398
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,891
Nobody uses that stuff in real life.

399
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,185
But what about French?

400
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,855
One always has letters to write.

401
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,441
Here's another secret
you and I can share.

402
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:24,114
If your next French essay

403
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,826
is in the top five,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!

404
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,455
But you mustn't tell your father.

405
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,053
"The dying man pulled himself up

406
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:14,057
and gave his children
a piercing look."

407
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:17,060
"The hair bristled
on the nape of his neck."

408
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,312
"His eyes lit up."

409
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,065
"A breath caressed his face
and made it sublime."

410
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,401
"He raised his hand in anger

411
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,112
and shouted Archimedes'
famous last words:

412
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,423
Eureka! I have found it."

413
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:47,924
<i>Describe a serious event you witnessed
that involved you personally.</i>

414
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,053
<i>Eureka! I have found it.</i>

415
00:48:55,558 --> 00:49:01,146
<i>"My Grandfather's Death."</i>

416
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,385
The boss is sleeping
with the new secretary.

417
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,096
She's well-armed, that girl,

418
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:39,309
and she used it to get promoted
to executive secretary.

419
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,271
She has all the necessary talents
for the position.

420
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,150
Now I'll have to watch out for her.
Pillow talk and all that.

421
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,738
I showed her how to fudge a bit
on travel expense reports.

422
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,908
She'd only stay in three-star hotels.

423
00:49:56,494 --> 00:50:00,413
By the way, I still haven't found
my Michelin guide.

424
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,166
One of you must have it.

425
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:07,379
- Don't start with your Michelin guide!
- I don't like mysteries!

426
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:12,008
- You left something on the stove again.
- No, I didn't.

427
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,135
What's got into him?

428
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,805
This is the last straw!

429
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,350
Stop shouting and get some water!

430
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,815
I've had it, you little idiot!

431
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,819
What got into you,
lighting a candle in there?

432
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,363
It was for Balzac.

433
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,700
- What do you take me for?
- It was for my French essay.

434
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,119
Leave him alone.
He promised me something.

435
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,038
What? To collect
on our fire insurance?

436
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:46,167
One candle won't do the job.
Here, try this!

437
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:51,047
As long as you're living under this roof,
you'll do as you're told.

438
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,883
Otherwise we've no other choice
but the military academy.

439
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,847
Know what that is?
They'll keep you in line, all right.

440
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,642
Know what we'll do
to lighten things up?

441
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,353
We'll all go to the movies.

442
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:09,232
Terrific.
Great way to teach him a lesson.

443
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:13,319
- Did you write a good essay?
- Not bad.

444
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,905
Julien.

445
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:20,368
You have to trust us.
You'll be pleasantly surprised.

446
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,747
- No more surprises!
- So are you taking us to the movies?

447
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,665
- What's showing?
- Paris Belongs to Us.

448
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,210
- If this is a plot...
- Unless you'd rather stay home.

449
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:33,006
Me? I've worked hard.
I deserve to go out.

450
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,635
But they're not fond
of arsonists at the theater.

451
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,867
I never had strawberry
ice cream before!

452
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,994
Must have been out of season.

453
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,130
She sure had... you know...
she had quite a...

454
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,382
That's all you noticed, eh?

455
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:17,592
A lot of class!

456
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,137
Having a good time back there?

457
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:23,765
I really liked the movie.

458
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,850
It wasn't funny.

459
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,937
But it had depth.

460
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,064
- What?
- It had depth.

461
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,317
The movie.

462
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,323
Here we are.

463
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,667
General Daredevil and his army!

464
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,211
You're gonna wake the whole building.

465
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,965
Look what pretty legs
your mother has.

466
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:11,104
Home sweet home.
A bit smoky, eh?

467
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,356
Sweetie, get the garbage.
Be a good boy.

468
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:18,194
See? I've won him over.
I hope I won't regret it.

469
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,496
Doinel, your paper is first today

470
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:14,918
only because I decided to return them
in order beginning with the worst.

471
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:19,505
Your search for perfection
led you straight to an F, my friend.

472
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:24,552
To those less familiar with Balzac,
what we have here is A Sinister Affair.

473
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:31,100
That Doinel chose to write about
his grandfather's death was his right.

474
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:35,897
We know he doesn't hesitate
to sacrifice his relatives, if necessary.

475
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,649
It's not true, sir. I didn't cheat.

476
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,609
Judge for yourselves.

477
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,820
"The dying man pulled himself up

478
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,865
and gave his children
a piercing look."

479
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,869
"The hair bristled
on the nape of his neck."

480
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,789
"His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime."

481
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,751
"He raised his hand in anger and
shouted Archimedes' famous last words:

482
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,461
Eureka! I have found it!"

483
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,171
Well, I've found it, too, Doinel.

484
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,549
- You're a miserable plagiarist!
- It's not true, sir.

485
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,719
Go to the principal's office
this instant.

486
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,639
Take this and go with him.

487
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,642
I don't want to see you
back here this term!

488
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,698
What are you doing?

489
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,618
I sit next to him.
I would have seen it if he had copied.

490
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:33,705
- You want to be suspended as well?
- I wouldn't mind.

491
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,624
More insolence!

492
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,586
- Get out!
- I don't want to. It's cold outside.

493
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,506
- Get out of here!
- This is illegal.

494
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,426
I'll show you who makes the law here!

495
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:50,463
Illegal, huh?

496
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:01,524
- Did you take him to the principal?
- No, he ran away.

497
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:13,161
I socked him in the jaw and took off.

498
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,704
What about you?

499
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,540
Sourpuss was furious.
I'm suspended till after Christmas.

500
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,209
Poor guy. I'm sorry.

501
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,674
I can't go home now.
That's for sure.

502
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,968
My father said he'd send me
to the academy.

503
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:32,221
- What academy?
- Something to do with the military.

504
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:35,183
You'll have a uniform.
Besides, there's a future in the army.

505
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:39,395
Maybe, but not for me.
If only it were the navy!

506
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,523
I've never seen the ocean.

507
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,525
I've seen the English Channel,
the Atlantic,

508
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,445
and the Mediterranean,
but not the North Sea.

509
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,615
Come on, stay at my place.
We'll manage.

510
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:19,268
Holy cow, a horse!

511
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,146
One of my father's souvenirs.

512
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,442
This place is huge.

513
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,280
You can sleep here.
No one will know.

514
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,116
What about your parents?

515
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,201
They never come in here.

516
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,121
My mother drinks, and my father
spends all day at the races.

517
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:42,792
First off, we've got to think of a way
to make some money.

518
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,002
Right, that's the first thing to do.

519
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:49,715
Right. Meanwhile, I'll take
an advance on my inheritance.

520
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,802
Don't make any noise.
My mother's out there somewhere.

521
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,769
Anyone there?

522
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,813
Good day, ma'am!

523
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,648
Little wretch!

524
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:42,138
- Have you seen your mother lately?
- Yes, when I came home from school.

525
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,059
She makes sure
she's never home when I am.

526
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,645
She must be up to something.

527
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,274
Where's the fruit?

528
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,174
Take this.

529
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:45,368
Heavens, 9:30!
I'll be late to the club.

530
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:06,222
Hurry up, or we'll miss the newsreel.

531
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,939
Boy, I'm thirsty!

532
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,778
Damn! It's empty.

533
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,780
Your turn. Hurry up.

534
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,907
What did you get? Twelve?

535
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:17,668
My old man!

536
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:21,672
Help me shake the blankets
to get rid of the smoke.

537
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,181
That's enough.

538
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,936
What's this?
It's a smokehouse in here!

539
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,605
It's like a gambling joint!

540
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:41,358
I'm taking the cost of three cigars
out of your allowance.

541
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,154
What's this?
Bucephalus is not a coat rack.

542
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,910
He's worth a million at least.
A real work of art.

543
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:54,288
I'll only get rid of him
if I'm forced to.

544
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:59,168
Now put the lights out
and go to sleep.

545
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,128
Good night, Dad.

546
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,678
Not bad.

547
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,472
Oh, my gosh!

548
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:23,025
- Let me see your Michelin guide.
- A million would really do it.

549
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:26,278
It's my dad's horse.
He'd kill me for sure.

550
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,864
Don't be a wimp.
We could head for the beach,

551
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,575
set up a boat business,
and get everyone off our backs.

552
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,137
- We've got to decide.
- There's one in my dad's office.

553
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,847
Then let's get it.

554
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,099
We can't sell it.
They're all numbered.

555
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:41,478
But we can hock it.
My mom has hocked everything we own.

556
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,487
- How much?
- Ten percent.

557
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,322
- Okay.
- A thousand in advance.

558
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:24,493
- No, when you've got the money.
- Trusting guys, aren't you?

559
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:02,197
Give us back our machine!
Where do you think you're going?

560
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,783
- I thought you were down there.
- Sure you did.

561
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,119
Anyway, it's no go.
They want to see a receipt.

562
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,829
Then give it back.

563
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:12,124
- Fine, but I want 500 for my trouble.
- We don't have it.

564
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:16,086
You must have something.
Three hundred and we're even.

565
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:19,923
- We're broke.
- I don't work for nothing.

566
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:23,468
- I'll keep it as a deposit.
- The hell you will! It's ours!

567
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:27,055
- Give it back or I'll slug you.
- Hands off!

568
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,974
It's no more yours than mine.

569
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,894
There's a cop. Let's ask him.

570
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,816
Fine, keep the damned thing,
you little shits.

571
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,406
- I'm tired of carrying this!
- I had my turn.

572
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,534
- My dad's gonna know it was me.
- It was your idea.

573
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,828
- It was yours, asshole!
- Come on!

574
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,373
- I don't care. I'm leaving it here.
- Are you nuts?

575
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,084
I've got to take it back
to the office at least.

576
01:10:56,336 --> 01:11:00,923
But I'm gonna wear a hat in case
the night watchman sees me.

577
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,301
Come on, take it back for me.

578
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,595
No, it wasn't my idea.

579
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:10,515
You're a real asshole.
At least hold it while I put on my hat.

580
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,726
And wait for me outside.

581
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,764
Well, if it isn't Doinel's son.
I must be seeing things!

582
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:54,726
Put that down.
Boy, is your daddy gonna love this!

583
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:59,564
I'll show them I know my job.

584
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:03,652
I'm warning you, don't try anything.

585
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,488
I don't like little punks like you.

586
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:11,493
Mr. Doinel, forgive me
for bothering you.

587
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,163
You better come here, sir.

588
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:20,669
Let's say it's a surprise...
but not a pleasant one.

589
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,632
Don't touch that hat!

590
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:33,682
It's no party I'm taking you to
this time.

591
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:37,352
The games are over. Your mother
and I will finally have some peace.

592
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:40,856
Take a good look at your pal,

593
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,942
'cause you won't be
seeing him again for a while.

594
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:02,544
Maybe this'll straighten you out.
This had to end sooner or later.

595
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,964
If I had done this at your age,
my father would have killed me!

596
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,510
May we see the chief?

597
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:19,686
We've tried everything:
kindness, persuasion, punishment.

598
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:21,646
But we never beat him, mind you.

599
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,941
- Sometimes the good old ways-
- Of course.

600
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,819
But his mother and I aren't like that.

601
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,697
- We gave him a lot of freedom.
- Too much, perhaps.

602
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:35,952
And with both of us working-
You know how it is.

603
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:38,497
Yes, I'm a father too.

604
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,041
I must admit it's not always easy.

605
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,960
If only he'd talk to us.

606
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,338
But when we talk to him,
he's a thousand miles away.

607
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,507
You think he's listening now?

608
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:52,094
Here's how I found him
with the typewriter.

609
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,596
Who knows what goes on
in that head of his!

610
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,893
Take this boy's statement.

611
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:02,437
Vagrancy and theft.

612
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,815
Come with me.

613
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,738
What have you decided?

614
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:16,326
We can't take him back home now.
He'll just run away again.

615
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:21,456
Perhaps you could place him somewhere,
like a camp in the country?

616
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:24,793
And put him to work,
'cause he won't study anymore.

617
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,712
We can try the Observation Center.

618
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:31,383
It's well organized,
and he'll learn a skill.

619
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,720
- It'll do him good.
- Assuming there's room, of course.

620
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,642
And you'd have to transfer
your parental rights.

621
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:44,813
Yes, to the juvenile justice system.

622
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:48,066
He'll appear in juvenile court tomorrow.

623
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,528
You or your wife must be present.

624
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,949
Did anyone see you enter the building?

625
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:02,789
"I hereby declare that,
having entered the premises..."

626
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,549
"...a typewriter."

627
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,263
Sign here.

628
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,766
Charles, he's all yours.

629
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,690
This way.

630
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,743
You take him from here.
I'm going home.

631
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,279
What did you do?

632
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,032
I ran away from home.

633
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,034
What about you?

634
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,578
Oh, you know...

635
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,498
Here come the girls.

636
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:17,340
I saw a police station in a movie once.
It was a lot cleaner.

637
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,970
- I saw one that was a lot dirtier.
- I've seen more cheerful ones.

638
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:08,867
The coach is here.

639
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,953
Put on your jacket.

640
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,491
Tie, belt and shoelaces.
Empty your pockets.

641
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,497
Sign here.

642
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,521

01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:43,726
We could try taking him back
if we had to,

644
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,521
We could try taking him back
if we had to,

645
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:49,273
but he'd have to change
his ways entirely.

646
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,943
If only you could scare some sense
into him, Your Honor.

647
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,279
- That's not my role.
- We can't control him.

648
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:59,283
Perhaps you exercise control
too inconsistently.

649
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:03,621
Is it true he was left home alone
for an entire weekend?

650
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,457
My husband belongs to a racing club.

651
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:09,127
We might have left him home alone.

652
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,753
Besides, he hates sports.

653
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:14,215
He prefers to hole up in a theater
for hours, ruining his eyes.

654
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,343
What does your husband think?
It's his son, after all.

655
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:20,930
Well, no, he isn't.

656
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,932
He married me when the boy was small.

657
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,101
He deserves credit for that.

658
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,980
- I shouldn't have told you that.
- On the contrary.

659
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:33,276
I think we'd best put the boy
in an observation center.

660
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:36,738
Could it be near the seashore,
Your Honor?

661
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,615
It's not a vacation resort, ma'am.

662
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:42,994
I'll do my best,
depending on what's available.

663
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:46,456
He'll stay there a few months
while I study his case.

664
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,958
Then we'll make a decision.

665
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:52,170
Believe me, this change
can only do him good.

666
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,839
Good-bye, Your Honor.

667
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:03,181
OBSERVATION CENTER
FOR DELINQUENT YOUTH

668
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:40,885
- Why are you in here?
- Oh, you know. What about you?

669
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,971
- I messed up.
- I stole a typewriter.

670
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:46,599
A typewriter?
That wasn't too smart.

671
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:50,770
No wonder you got caught.
They all have serial numbers.

672
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:55,399
See that big guy over there?
He stole tires off cars.

673
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:59,278
Whenever I'd cry,

674
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:04,033
my father would imitate me
on his violin, just to bug me.

675
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,912
But one day I snapped
and just knocked him out cold.

676
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,832
Good for you. If my old man
did that to me, I'd kill him.

677
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:16,128
- Look!
- Who's that guy?

678
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:19,465
He escaped a week ago,
but they got him.

679
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:25,179
Around here, to escape is bad enough,
but to get caught is worse.

680
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:37,525
What are you doing there?
Two lines, on the double!

681
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,903
What are you up to there?
Now march!

682
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,757
Show me your bread.

683
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:44,926
Good.

684
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,428
I see you started already.

685
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:49,931
Bring your bread and plate over here.

686
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,104
Put them down.

687
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,110
Right hand or left?

688
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,488
Left, sir.

689
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,622
No talking!

690
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,298
This is for you.

691
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:28,052
I bet they'd catch you, and I won.

692
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:36,018
So what? I lived it up for five days,

693
01:28:36,103 --> 01:28:38,521
and I'm ready to try it again
first chance I get.

694
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,564
What are you doing there?

695
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,987
Kanayan, your turn
to see the psychologist.

696
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:49,031
If she drops her pen, pick it up,

697
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,826
but don't look at her legs,
or else it goes in your file.

698
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,536
What file?

699
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:56,831
You know, what everyone thinks of you:
the judge, the doctor,

700
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,083
even your neighbors back home.

701
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,585
I know mine by heart.

702
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:05,965
It says I'm unstable,
with perverted tendencies.

703
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,300
What if I talk nonsense
just to confuse them?

704
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,346
Then it's the funny farm
or boot camp.

705
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,896
Why did you return the typewriter?

706
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:25,693
Well, since I couldn't sell it
or anything, I got scared.

707
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,655
I don't know why I returned it.
Just 'cause.

708
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,701
It seems you stole 10,000 francs
from your grandmother.

709
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,328
She had invited me for her birthday.

710
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:41,542
I thought since she's old and doesn't
eat much, she doesn't need the money.

711
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:43,210
She was going to die soon.

712
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:47,173
So, since I knew where she kept
her dough, I swiped some.

713
01:29:47,758 --> 01:29:52,053
I knew she wouldn't notice,
and she didn't.

714
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,765
She gave me a nice book that day.

715
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,811
But my mother,
she used to go through my pockets.

716
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:03,147
I left my pants on the bed that night,

717
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:08,402
and she must have found the money in
my pocket, 'cause next day it was gone.

718
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:13,157
Later, she mentioned it and
I had to confess where I got it.

719
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,827
And then she took the nice book away
my grandmother gave me.

720
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,955
One day I asked for it back,

721
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,958
and I found out she'd sold it.

722
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:27,088
Your parents say you're always lying.

723
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:31,008
Oh, I lie now and then, I suppose.

724
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:34,386
Sometimes I'd tell them the truth
and they still wouldn't believe me,

725
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:36,680
so I prefer to lie.

726
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,141
Why don't you like your mother?

727
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:42,144
Well, first she sent me
to live with a wet nurse.

728
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,439
Then, when they had no more money,
they sent me to my grandmother.

729
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:49,485
But she got old and
couldn't take care of me anymore,

730
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:53,322
so, when I was eight,
I went back to live with my parents.

731
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,950
I could tell Mother didn't like me.

732
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:59,954
She was always yelling at me
for no reason.

733
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:06,377
There were fights at home,

734
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,505
and I overheard

735
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:16,637
that my mother had me
before she was married.

736
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:21,308
And she had a fight
with my grandmother once.

737
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,562
That's when I found out that
she had wanted to have an abortion.

738
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:27,022
It's thanks to my grandmother
that I was born.

739
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,151
Have you ever slept with a girl?

740
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,740
No, but some friends of mine have.

741
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:41,328
They told me where
the hookers hang out.

742
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:45,624
So I went and tried
to pick up some girls,

743
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:49,003
but they all yelled at me
so I got scared and I left.

744
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:51,463
I went back a couple times.

745
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:55,342
Once a man saw me and asked me
what I was doing there.

746
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,387
He was North African.
So I told him.

747
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:04,518
I guess he knew a lot of women,
and he said he knew one

748
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:08,063
who liked guys my age.

749
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:12,109
So he took me to her hotel,

750
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,112
only she wasn't there that day.

751
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:19,033
We waited an hour or two,
but she didn't show up, so I left.

752
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:51,398
RenÈ!

753
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:19,426
Don't look for your father.
I came alone.

754
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,387
Is it that way?

755
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,664
Your letter to your father
hurt him very much.

756
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:51,917
You were naÔve to think
he wouldn't show it to me.

757
01:33:52,002 --> 01:33:54,628
In spite of appearances,
we're a devoted couple,

758
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:58,632
and it wasn't smart to remind him
of some unhappy days I went through.

759
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,468
Thanks to him, you have a name.

760
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:07,182
We were ready to take you back,

761
01:34:07,434 --> 01:34:09,601
but the neighbors' gossip
put an end to that.

762
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,062
You must have told
everyone in the neighborhood!

763
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:14,231
I never said a word, Mother.

764
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:18,152
But I'm used to it. I've been
criticized by imbeciles all my life.

765
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:21,071
Anyway, that's all I had to tell you.

766
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,615
And don't go crying to your father.

767
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:27,536
He said to let you know he's washed
his hands of you completely.

768
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:31,415
All you're good for now is
reform school or a labor center.

769
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,042
You wanted to earn your living?

770
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:36,337
Now we'll see how you like it.

771
01:39:52,845 --> 01:39:56,045
THE END

1
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,898
THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR

2
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,777
Directed by Francois Trauffaut

3
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:32,418
It was still dark

4
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,659
when the squad car
left Grenoble.

5
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:36,825
The village is 15 miles away.

6
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,981
The ambulance is probably
already there

7
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:41,946
for it left from Chambery.

8
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:43,701
I am Odile Jouve.

9
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:45,825
You think I'm a tennis player?

10
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:47,706
Well you're wrong.

11
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,108
If the camera
would pull back a little

12
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,140
you'll see what I mean.

13
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,106
Go on, pull back!

14
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,340
Now, you see!

15
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,701
Let's sit down over there.

16
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:07,617
No, this will do.

17
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:14,467
I manage this tennis club.

18
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,699
Its members are from Grenoble

19
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,461
and other regions nearby.

20
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,422
They all know each other here

21
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,227
and I know everybody.

22
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:24,345
It started six months ago.

23
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:27,178
You might say
it goes back ten years

24
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,227
but it was actually
six months ago.

25
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,145
Houses can be characters
in a story.

26
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,305
In this one, the principals

27
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:38,425
are two neighboring houses.

28
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,508
One is the home
of Bernard Coudray,

29
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:46,502
his wife Arlette
and their son, Thomas.

30
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:49,018
Here they are,
posing for a friend

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,508
who was never found.

32
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:51,948
The second house...

33
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,179
we'll get back to it later.

34
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:58,388
As you see,
it was still unoccupied

35
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,141
when it all started.

36
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,544
Hi, how are you?

37
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:21,857
You okay, Thomas?

38
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:25,742
My boy.

39
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:30,420
Hello!
- Hi.

40
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,948
Can I help?

41
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,588
No, thanks.

42
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,387
So, you've rented the house?

43
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,348
No, I'm from the
real estate agency.

44
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,863
Mr. Bauchard is the new tenant.

45
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,018
Philippe Bauchard.

46
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:43,781
Bernard Coudray.

47
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:45,941
I must make a phone call.

48
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:48,338
I'm sorry, but the phone

49
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,420
won't be connected
till next week.

50
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,302
Use our phone.

51
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,424
I don't want to disturb...

52
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:56,740
Please, come on!
- I'll wait here.

53
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:59,178
If you run into any problems,

54
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,748
be sure to call on us.

55
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,138
There...

56
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,543
Do come in.

57
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,342
Thank you.

58
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:24,261
Is he our new neighbor?

59
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,782
Yes. Be quiet.

60
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:28,019
He's moving in next week.

61
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,258
With his wife?

62
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,544
I don't know if he's married.

63
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,142
He wears a wedding ring.

64
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,106
Then, we'll have new neighbors.

65
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,547
Come to think of it...

66
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,824
we'll have to be careful.

67
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,864
No more love-making on the lawn.

68
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,667
We can do it quietly.

69
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:52,547
No! No more outdoor sex.

70
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,745
Anyway, I always catch cold

71
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,303
from the damp grass.

72
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,744
I hate it! Never again!

73
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,867
Wait for me, Thomas!

74
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,820
Can I carry the suitcase, sir?

75
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,627
Sure, if you like.

76
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,268
That way...

77
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,342
Can I put it down?

78
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,657
Yes. Fine.

79
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:31,221
Thomas! Where are you?

80
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,698
I think he went to the neighbor's.

81
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:38,823
Hello.
- Hello.

82
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,740
Is he in your way?
- Not at all.

83
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,583
Thomas,
your pal's waiting for you.

84
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,581
It's funny,
they're both called Thomas.

85
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:48,943
It's a real mess.

86
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,020
Come in.
You probably know the house.

87
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,303
No.

88
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,459
I've never been inside.

89
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:58,861
You must meet my wife.
Come down!

90
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:02,385
That's the trouble with rentals.

91
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,586
You've got to fit your stuff
into the new set-up.

92
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,347
Mathilde, my wife.
The Coudrays.

93
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:11,987
How do you do?

94
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:14,698
Bernard. Hi.

95
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:15,904
Hello.

96
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:21,186
I'll put the lights out.

97
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:25,897
Thomas always leaves a trail!

98
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,300
Like the Indians in Arizona.

99
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,783
Some Indian!

100
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:31,541
Here.
- Hang on...

101
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,983
Damn it!

102
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,058
Did you wake him?

103
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,502
No, he's fast asleep.

104
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,345
Is he asleep?
- Yes.

105
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,180
Their lights are out.

106
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,300
They go to bed earlier
than we do.

107
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,059
The pilot's wife is a real beauty.

108
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,709
He's not a pilot
but an air controller.

109
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:14,778
Really?

110
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,747
Yes, he works
at the Grenoble airport.

111
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:20,423
I steer boats and he guides planes.

112
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,580
Isn't his wife beautiful?

113
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,543
I think she's rather unusual.

114
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,662
Well, I think she doesn't belong here.

115
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,983
What do you mean?

116
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:33,981
Look, we live here because we love

117
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,348
the land, the trees,

118
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,942
the natural environment.

119
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,019
She just doesn't belong here!

120
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:39,578
Yes?

121
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,900
I know you're alone.
Can we talk?

122
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,428
We can talk anytime.

123
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,421
Sure, but I don't want
to embarras you.

124
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,544
You know what I mean.

125
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,824
What did you tell your wife?

126
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,668
Did you tell her
we know each other?

127
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:55,138
Did you tell your husband?

128
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,827
Not yet, but I will.

129
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:58,786
He trusts me,
he's understanding.

130
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,143
He's a wonderful man.

131
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,186
Good for you. So long!

132
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,067
Don't hang up.
Wait, wait...

133
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,377
I'm waiting.

134
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,779
Have I changed much?

135
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:12,780
No, you're exactly the same.

136
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,587
You sound nasty.

137
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,177
I didn't move in next door
on purpose.

138
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:20,986
Phillipe wanted to surprise me.

139
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,347
If I'd known beforehand,
I'd have found

140
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:25,987
a pretext to turn it down.

141
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,787
But since it's a fluke,

142
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,143
let's accept it as such.

143
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,026
I've got to go to work.

144
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,221
Wait! Tell me about yourself.

145
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,583
There's nothing to tell.

146
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,866
In case you need me...
take my number. Got a pencil?

147
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:40,746
No. I don't need anything.

148
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:51,863
Bernard...

149
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,498
Bernard.

150
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,304
What's wrong?
Can't you sleep?

151
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,583
I'm hungry.

152
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,587
Didn't you eat enough at dinner?
- Yes. I did.

153
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,099
So?
- I'm hungry again.

154
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,747
Why sit in the dark?

155
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:21,744
I'll light up.

156
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,341
What's the matter?

157
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:37,944
You seem worried.
- No...

158
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:42,541
but I want to suggest something.

159
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,098
Let's go away for a week or two.

160
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:49,908
With Thomas.
Like around the 8th.

161
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,184
It's out of the question.

162
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,464
Thomas can't miss school.

163
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,108
Let me get an apple.

164
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:01,420
Besides,
they're auditing the lab books

165
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:03,301
I've got my hands full.

166
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:05,940
No, it's impossible.

167
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,298
Don't eat the salmon.
Have an apple.

168
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:11,505
The salmon is for our guests.

169
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:12,817
What guests?

170
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:16,300
I invited our neighbors over
for dinner tomorrow.

171
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,425
What did you do that for?

172
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:21,658
Well...

173
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,220
The wife is very charming.

174
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,585
I thought you'd be pleased!

175
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:35,182
Still...

176
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,386
Do you want me to put it off?

177
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:40,188
We can do it some other time.

178
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,544
It's too late to change now.

179
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,343
Never mind...

180
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,503
Listen!

181
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:51,822
It's the cats.

182
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:53,702
They're fighting.

183
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:56,901
They're making love

184
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,101
like mad!

185
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,780
So long.

186
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,784
At what time will you be home?

187
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,461
At eight.
- Right.

188
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,388
Hello there!

189
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,425
Just getting up?
- Yes.

190
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:23,819
Remember to pick up the groceries.
They promised to put them aside...

191
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:25,547
Don't worry!
- Don't forget!

192
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:26,982
I won't.

193
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,025
Your briefcase!

194
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,625
Bernard, your briefcase!

195
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,068
Going to work?

196
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,617
Damn it! The door's locked.

197
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,741
I'm locked out!

198
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,262
It's the inside lock!

199
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:47,101
Go in the back way.

200
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,507
I can do it.

201
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,507
Okay, try it.

202
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:55,540
Slide over to the front.

203
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,780
Hurry up!
Just press the red button.

204
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,465
Fine. Come on out.
I'm late.

205
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,498
Hurry up!

206
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:09,102
Remember the store!

207
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:11,100
Right! I've got the list!

208
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:17,224
Don't forget

209
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,106
you're coming over tonight.

210
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,061
Dock number five!

211
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:00,827
Why does the sun circle around?

212
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,020
I wonder what's holding up Bernard.

213
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,548
Here.
- Thank you.

214
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,859
Thomas! Is he bothering you?

215
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:07,938
Not at all.

216
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,257
Behave!

217
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,538
Mr. Bauchard...

218
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:12,182
Just call me Philippe.

219
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,782
Philippe, won't you sit down?

220
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,700
No, I sit all day long.

221
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,586
Be back in a second.

222
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,105
I wonder what's happened to Bernard.

223
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,464
He should be home by now.

224
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:29,905
He's not working late tonight.

225
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:32,867
Your husband works
on tankers, yes?

226
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,588
He's an instructor
on heavy tankers.

227
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:39,105
He trains them on a small lake.

228
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:42,699
The captains take refresher courses
on miniature models.

229
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,349
Miniatures, like toys?
- Not exactly.

230
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,306
They're certainly not toys.

231
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:49,579
They're actually scale models.

232
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,785
Yes, one-fourth their normal size.

233
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:54,264
That's about the size of a barge.

234
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:56,909
Right. Where on earth is he?

235
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,417
That must be him!

236
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:02,468
Dad?

237
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:03,743
Give him to me.

238
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:07,659
Bernard? What's going on?

239
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,866
You could have let me know.

240
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:14,027
It's Bernard. He can't
make dinner. He's stuck.

241
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:17,499
Try to get here in time for dessert.

242
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:18,704
You hear?

243
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:20,018
All right.

244
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,065
He asks to excuse him.

245
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,468
We're expecting you.

246
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:26,222
Do your best!
- Goodbye.

247
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,858
I couldn't help overhearing you.

248
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,065
And you were lying.

249
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:37,384
That's not nice!

250
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,187
Yes, I lied.

251
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,426
It's true.

252
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,461
But I don't make a habit of it.

253
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,540
Well, you were very convincing.

254
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,785
Now, I can blackmail you.

255
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,178
You may buy me off
with a bourbon.

256
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,063
It's a deal.

257
00:14:57,869 --> 00:14:59,382
What will you have?

258
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:01,585
I don't know.
I'll serve you first.

259
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,227
Do that, dear liar.

260
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:07,018
Wait... let me explain.

261
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,339
A couple just moved in next door...

262
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,266
and Arlette's already
invited them

263
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:13,101
over to dinner.

264
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:14,588
Don't you like them?

265
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:17,058
That's not the point, but I'm slow.

266
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:20,221
I've got to get used to people.

267
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:21,943
Besides, it's a drag.

268
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,348
Tonight we invite them.

269
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,187
Next week they invite us.

270
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,788
It becomes a ritual.

271
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:29,783
What do they do?
Are they nice?

272
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:32,099
He's an air controller.

273
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:34,657
He works at the Grenoble airport.

274
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,024
He's relaxed and phlegmatic,

275
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:39,227
like an Englishman.

276
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,742
What about her?

277
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,781
I don't know.

278
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,741
She's rather unpredictable.

279
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:47,622
I think she's the kind

280
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,018
who likes to borrow trouble.

281
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,062
I don't know what you mean.

282
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:54,260
Look, since you're not going home

283
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,707
you can share my chow.

284
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,381
Oh no, Mrs. Jouve!

285
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:00,061
Come on, it's an off-night.

286
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:02,424
I'll just grab a cheese sandwich.

287
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,147
Over my dead body!

288
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:06,937
We'll share my veal stew.

289
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:11,788
But first, I've got to feed Benito.

290
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:17,218
Did you hurt yourself?

291
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,345
Help me up.

292
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,824
My prosthesis turns some men on.

293
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,139
A few days ago,
in Grenoble, a man

294
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:30,140
followed me in the street for hours.

295
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:32,504
I tried to shake him but I couldn't.

296
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:33,908
Finally, he spoke to me.

297
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,941
I might have guessed!
A fetichist!

298
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,178
I'm not surprised.

299
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,066
I saw a movie about that.

300
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:43,226
The heroine hated a man's hugs.

301
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,982
She just couldn't stand it.

302
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,267
So the man cut his arms off.
- Both arms?

303
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,024
I'm not sure. One arm, or both.

304
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,669
In any case, he did it for love.

305
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,580
So did I. I did it for love.

306
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,303
Really?

307
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,262
For love...?

308
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:01,987
I heard it was an accident.

309
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,667
It was a so-called accident.

310
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,419
"An accident" in quotes!

311
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:07,737
What did they say?

312
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,548
That you fell from the 8th floor...

313
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,903
Only the 7th floor.

314
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,823
And by luck, you landed
on a glass casing, just below.

315
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,345
Right. It was in Nice,
and it was above a studio.

316
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,307
If not for that casing,
I wouldn't be here today!

317
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:24,307
But it's ancient history.

318
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:26,107
It happened almost 20 years ago.

319
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,828
At the time of the Putsch in Algeria.

320
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:31,264
I might as well tell you the truth

321
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,101
because I like you.

322
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,061
I didn't fall out.

323
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,259
I jumped out of that window.

324
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,305
That took courage!

325
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:44,904
Nonsense!
It's not a matter of courage.

326
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:48,339
I was desperate... and in love.

327
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,858
He jilted me
and went to New Caledonia.

328
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,378
Like an idiot, I kept on hoping

329
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,102
until I heard he'd gotten married.

330
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,623
That did it!

331
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:01,385
What did he say when he heard?

332
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:03,579
I made sure he'd never know.

333
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,102
It's just as well.

334
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:07,259
That's true.

335
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:11,546
Men prefer not to know
about these things.

336
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,142
They're so right!

337
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:15,340
By now, I feel the thing

338
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,306
was tragic, but not fatal.

339
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,825
Like the Piaf song:

340
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:21,945
"I have no regrets!"

341
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:27,905
Hey there! Are you dreaming?

342
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:30,549
No, I'm listening.

343
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,701
I'm glad you came.

344
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,701
It's too bad about Bernard.

345
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,706
Never mind, we enjoyed it.

346
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,144
Right! Next time,
we'll invite you.

347
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,027
Fine!
- Good night. - Good night.

348
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:46,906
Good night.
- Good night.

349
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,457
Surprise!

350
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,342
Do you mind if I walk along?

351
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:10,142
I want you to know
we had a good time.

352
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:12,299
Your wife made us a delicious meal.

353
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,189
Naturally, we talked about you.

354
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:17,067
Is your car outside?

355
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,141
Look, let's get this straight.

356
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:22,743
That dinner party was her idea.

357
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:24,777
Maybe so,

358
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,260
but we're neighbors now

359
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,987
in a tiny village.

360
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:33,147
So let's face it.

361
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,943
Besides, we're adults now,
aren't we?

362
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:43,299
You've got a nice kid.
Looks like you.

363
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,143
You're surely happy.

364
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:46,867
Yes, I'm happy.

365
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,063
I mean I was,
until you turned up.

366
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,617
That's why we've got to talk.

367
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,820
Look, I'm not trying
to make you feel guilty...

368
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,383
but don't forget I went through hell!

369
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:05,658
You couldn't stand me, you left.

370
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,257
Then you couldn't live without me.

371
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,743
So I worked up the guts to quit.

372
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,905
If I hadn't, I'd have gone crazy.

373
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,025
Now that we're both over it,

374
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,986
can't we be friends?

375
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:24,539
I suppose you're right.

376
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,427
I guess I resent hurting you

377
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,818
as much as I resent you
hurting me.

378
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:35,184
I'm glad you're happy now.

379
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:37,225
That's better.

380
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:40,298
Next week Philippe and I

381
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,862
will invite you to dinner

382
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:43,428
with Arlette, of course.

383
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:46,781
Promise you won't let us down.

384
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:48,624
I promise.

385
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:52,741
I'll be there like Old Faithful.

386
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:04,708
How about a kiss?

387
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:05,778
Sure.

388
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,500
I want to ask another favor.

389
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:19,979
Say my name from time to time.

390
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:22,022
In the past,
I could always tell

391
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:25,465
when you were feeling hostile...

392
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,428
because you never called me Mathilde.

393
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:31,060
You've probably forgotten.

394
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:38,661
Mathilde...

395
00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:54,584
Mathilde...

396
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,062
Will you be all right?

397
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:42,463
See, you just look at the ball.

398
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:45,421
Look at the ball!

399
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:50,418
Bernard!

400
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,104
There's your mother.

401
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:53,218
You okay?

402
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:22,624
I love beautiful hair,

403
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,623
especially dark hair.
There are too many blondes.

404
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:27,262
Where? Here, or in general?

405
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,988
Both. It's because of movies and TV

406
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,537
but mostly the commercials.

407
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,620
So, here you are!
- Hello, Odile.

408
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:35,824
Hello.

409
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,467
Did you drive here?

410
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,178
Are you here for the day?

411
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,021
For the whole weekend.

412
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,302
I'll stay at the Pergola.

413
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:46,426
Are you crazy?

414
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,739
Cancel the room.
You'll stay here!

415
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:49,784
Fine!

416
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:51,666
I need to make a phone call.

417
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:53,102
He's a gem.

418
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:54,986
I'd be lost without him.

419
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,266
All the things he's done for me...

420
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:01,666
Excuse me for not introducing you,

421
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:02,818
I forgot your name.

422
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:04,388
I'm Mathilde Bauchard.

423
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,188
We're Bernard's new neighbors.

424
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:11,228
Of course! I've heard about you.

425
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:15,024
But you don't seem the kind
to borrow trouble.

426
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,468
Why?

427
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,308
Philippe! Well?

428
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,667
Roland!
I wasn't sure. The beard...

429
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,502
Besides, I'm a little older.

430
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,102
How long has it been?
Four years?

431
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:39,622
I think it's five.

432
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:41,217
This is great!

433
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,869
Mathilde! Come!
This is Roland Duguet.

434
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:47,421
We were teammates
in the Corsica rally.

435
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:50,228
Without him,
I doubt... Mathilde.

436
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:52,584
Mademoiselle.
- Madame! Hello.

437
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:54,387
That's right. We're married.

438
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,027
Congratulations!

439
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:58,304
We were about to play a game.

440
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,266
No, stay here with your friend.

441
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:02,305
I'll practice.

442
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,662
A local publisher, isn't it tough?

443
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:12,307
There are more advantages

444
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,459
than drawbacks,
actually, Bauchard.

445
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:16,386
And I was fed up with Paris.

446
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:17,948
Just call me Philippe.

447
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,508
Of course!
I always tend to be formal.

448
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,341
I find it difficult.

449
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:23,902
Mathilde is beautiful.

450
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,067
She looks foreign.

451
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,468
Italian perhaps?

452
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:29,983
No, she's from the south of France.

453
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:31,938
As soon as we met,

454
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,099
I knew she'd be important to me.

455
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:38,744
I never sought out
the ideal woman

456
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,666
or any woman, in fact.

457
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,148
But when I met Mathilde,

458
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:45,107
she seemed like a promise.

459
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,544
In fact,
I remember thinking:

460
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:50,427
"Here is my last chance
for happiness."

461
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:02,622
Mme Jouve, please.

462
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:06,703
Hello. Mme Jouve?
- Over there.

463
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:16,582
I'm looking for Mme Jouve.

464
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:19,018
Ask the barman. He'll know.

465
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,385
Mme Jouve, please.

466
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:35,744
Mme Jouve?

467
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,300
What's wrong? Can I help?

468
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:25,426
No, thanks. I'll be fine.

469
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,386
You seem upset.

470
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:30,541
Yes, I got a cable, a rotten cable.

471
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,540
But I'll ignore it.

472
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,097
Can't I help?
- No, never mind.

473
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:40,785
You know you can count on me.

474
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,949
I hear you do children's books.

475
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:51,827
Philippe is always promoting me!

476
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:53,786
He says you're talented,

477
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,427
but you lack confidence.

478
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,784
Too true! I wrote a few stories and

479
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,383
illustrated them,
but it's amateurish.

480
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:01,788
I might be interested.

481
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,461
I want to publish some albums.

482
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,939
What kind of drawings?
Vignettes?

483
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:07,747
No, I use a margin

484
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,547
and a 2 or 3 point line.

485
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:11,381
I work in India ink and colored ink,

486
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:12,743
but I never use
more than four colors

487
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,706
for quadrichrome reproduction.

488
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,020
That's hardly amateurish!

489
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:20,187
Well, I worked at Okapi's
for 3 months

490
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,021
but that was years ago.

491
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,026
I quit because of illness.

492
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:26,225
There are new techniques now.

493
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,539
Techniques may change,

494
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:30,267
but we can always use a good story.

495
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:32,544
I'd really like to see your work.

496
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,466
Since you've got no partner,

497
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:50,982
how about a game with me?

498
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,347
I can't. I think I hurt my wrist.

499
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:57,181
Simple as ever, I see.

500
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,902
It's me.

501
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:22,019
Let's meet tomorrow at 6 p.m.

502
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,622
Rue de la Gare.

503
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:26,701
Don't forget, at 6 p.m.

504
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:47,745
I made a phone reservation. Coudray.

505
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:49,900
Right. Number 18.

506
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:53,578
She took the key. Go on up.

507
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:55,625
Thanks. First floor?
- Yes.

508
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:06,981
Sir...

509
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:19,583
This way...

510
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:30,424
Come along, sir.

511
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:49,741
Look at this mess!

512
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:57,220
You had one just like this.

513
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,537
It was shorter.

514
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:00,028
You were smaller!

515
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,703
No, idiot!
The styles were shorter.

516
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:06,145
I bet you forgot our first meeting.

517
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:07,942
No.

518
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:11,103
It was at a children's party.

519
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,828
I came through the garden
and saw you

520
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,581
framed through the window.

521
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,267
You were feeding the children

522
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:19,862
and that did it:

523
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:22,942
I fell in love with you right there!

524
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:27,266
After which you declared your love

525
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:29,783
by getting completely drunk.

526
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:33,267
You said,
"I'm not drunk, Mathilde.

527
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:35,863
"I can prove it
by my lucid reasoning."

528
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:37,861
You reasoned on and on, while

529
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,463
I thought,
"why doesn't he kiss me?"

530
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:43,822
Don't talk,

531
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,020
just caress my face.

532
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:49,705
Wait, wait...

533
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:52,826
I'm waiting.

534
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:08,298
What's this?

535
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:10,348
How could you?

536
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:13,262
Mind your own business, my friend.

537
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,217
I'm not your friend.

538
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,584
I'm your lover, your ex-Iover.

539
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,457
My lover thought
he had a backbone

540
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:24,864
but it was just a carapace

541
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:27,265
and when it cracked,

542
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:29,147
he hated Mathilde.

543
00:34:29,229 --> 00:34:31,265
You're right,
I truly hated you.

544
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:34,984
For a long time,
but not anymore.

545
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,381
I've changed a lot.

546
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:39,859
Yes, you have changed.

547
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,302
It was ill-timed.

548
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:46,341
If we'd met now,
it might have worked.

549
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,704
Well, we've just met.

550
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:51,348
It's not the same.

551
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,507
Not the same thing.

552
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:04,704
You're even more beautiful now.

553
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,508
It's true.

554
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:09,748
We were both too young,

555
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:11,865
but now we understand each other.

556
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:15,585
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

557
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,183
We were in love.

558
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:26,543
No, I loved you.

559
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:28,540
You were merely in love.

560
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,023
What's more,
you had no faith in me.

561
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,464
"I love you because I love you"...

562
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,619
Well?
Wasn't that a good reason?

563
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:40,382
Besides, you were a skirt-chaser.

564
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:49,144
I was always intrigued

565
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:50,628
by the wonders they concealed.

566
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:53,063
And now?

567
00:35:56,549 --> 00:35:57,777
Sometimes...

568
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:09,867
You were tender with me.

569
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:12,101
So were you.

570
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,108
Wait...

571
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:17,421
Wait...

572
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,388
I'm waiting.

573
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:36,098
This looks like a battlefield.

574
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:38,740
Your hair's in your eyes.

575
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,663
I just wanted to see that gesture.

576
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:45,181
The first time you did it,
I thought:

577
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:49,304
If he asks me
to sleep with him, I will.

578
00:36:57,709 --> 00:36:59,301
Let's rent this by the month.

579
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:00,981
Why?
We can get it when we like.

580
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,822
I resent other couples
making love in our bed.

581
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:12,063
Air-Inter 323.
Next to the right.

582
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:14,501
Parking B1.

583
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:16,985
You're wanted downstairs.

584
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:21,225
I put him in B1.

585
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:30,538
Mme Jouve is taking a plane.

586
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,028
Will you give this to Mathilde?

587
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:33,588
What is it?
- She knows.

588
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,222
Tell her she can reach me

589
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:37,584
at the tennis club all week.

590
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:40,183
Odile's asked me
to keep an eye on it.

591
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,186
It's hard to believe

592
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:45,658
but she's leaving town
for a few days.

593
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:47,068
Take care of Mathilde.

594
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:50,266
I mean it.
Take good care of her!

595
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:51,702
I will.

596
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:55,266
Have a good time in Paris.

597
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,419
I've got to get back to work.

598
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,465
Are you in charge
of our take-off?

599
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:02,824
Spare us the fancy pirouettes!

600
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:17,019
I see you've allowed
for the captions.

601
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:18,462
I bet you even estimated

602
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,062
the copy space.

603
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,387
I admit I was tempted to.

604
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,504
Mr. Roland...

605
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:27,467
That man at the bar,

606
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:29,188
he's waiting for Mme Jouve.

607
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:31,737
I told him she's out of town.

608
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,342
He was here this morning.

609
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:35,818
I'll talk to him.
I'll be right back.

610
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,425
He was snooping around

611
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:48,784
when I came to work.

612
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:04,541
It's very strange.

613
00:39:04,669 --> 00:39:07,741
That man...
don't look at him!

614
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:10,389
He claims he came to see Odile Jouve

615
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:13,302
all the way from New Caledonia.

616
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:16,945
From New Caledonia? Really?
- He claims she knew he was coming.

617
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,940
If she had, I'm sure

618
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:21,304
she wouldn't have left town.

619
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:23,097
There he goes!

620
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:43,941
I'll have more strawberries.

621
00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:45,257
Coffee, everybody?

622
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,619
Not for me, thanks.

623
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:49,660
Then, three coffees.

624
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,941
Don't forget the sugar.

625
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,621
Come here.

626
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:01,505
Tomorrow at 6.
- No!

627
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:04,103
Yes! I must talk to you.
- No!

628
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:06,020
Bernard, can you bring the cups?

629
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:07,667
I'll help you.

630
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:10,028
Here's the coffee.

631
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:12,347
Let's sit over here.

632
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:14,543
Sit here.

633
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:19,380
The room has really changed.

634
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:21,425
We did fix it up a bit.

635
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:22,703
Wonderful fireplace.

636
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:25,223
Yes. The piano's a bit bulky.

637
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:26,947
Thanks.
- Not really.

638
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:28,223
Thanks.

639
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:33,062
Sugar?

640
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:37,108
What's this?

641
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:38,588
Your present.

642
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:40,343
My present?

643
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:43,666
I meant to wait...
- Your birthday? We didn't know...

644
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:45,182
It's not my birthday!

645
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:46,861
It's a separation gift.

646
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,348
What separation?

647
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:49,828
I'm leaving for three days.

648
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:51,661
Mathilde wouldn't come.

649
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,388
She wants to move
the furniture around.

650
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:56,664
God help us!

651
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:58,102
Why don't you open it?

652
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,542
I'm dying to...

653
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,107
I think I know...

654
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:06,941
We saw it in a shop...

655
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:08,348
Mathilde adored it.

656
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:10,863
So we went in.

657
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,946
She tried it on...

658
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:15,259
I realized I wouldn't dare

659
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:16,668
wear it in public.

660
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:18,740
It's a lovely dress,

661
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:20,023
it's not shocking.

662
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:21,861
Not to look at, but...

663
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,746
Try it on...
Let them see it.

664
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,308
He's right.

665
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:27,266
Here? Now?

666
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,308
I'll help you.

667
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:32,064
Fine.

668
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:35,466
Let's go up.

669
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:41,183
This way.

670
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,980
It's really wonderful

671
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,821
to hear Mathilde laugh.

672
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:54,225
When I first met her

673
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:57,063
she was as lovely as she is now,

674
00:41:57,149 --> 00:41:58,707
but she never laughed.

675
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:00,666
At most, a vague smile.

676
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:04,906
She had just divorced.

677
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:06,218
Divorced?

678
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:09,028
A blitz divorce
after a blitz wedding.

679
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,104
What's going on?

680
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:16,788
It's in the street.

681
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:30,626
Does this happen often?

682
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,301
Sometimes,

683
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:34,187
only when a house
looks unoccupied.

684
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:37,022
It's best to always leave
the lights on in the house.

685
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:42,298
The neckline's fine. A little...

686
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:44,141
It's superb. I knew it.

687
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,298
Didn't I tell you?

688
00:42:46,749 --> 00:42:49,741
It's not shocking to me.

689
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:52,263
You won't mind if she wears it
while you're away.

690
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:55,421
She'll wear it
whenever she pleases.

691
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,864
I'm not a Latin husband.

692
00:42:58,149 --> 00:43:00,743
Can you help me
with the cups? - Sure.

693
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:08,148
You know that boutique...

694
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:13,025
I'll see you tomorrow at 6.

695
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,508
Hello.

696
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:22,700
Where's the key for 18?

697
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:24,984
He got here first today.

698
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,422
Thanks.

699
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:53,268
What's the matter?

700
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:57,103
Come in.

701
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:06,348
Look, Bernard...

702
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:08,941
You wanted to talk.

703
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:11,460
Let's talk downstairs.

704
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,228
Why not in the room?

705
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:16,938
I know you and I know myself.

706
00:44:17,229 --> 00:44:21,541
And I don't like taking advantage
of Philippe's absence.

707
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:26,666
We need some sugar.

708
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:30,859
Where is it
- Can I help you?

709
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:33,383
No...
The sugar.

710
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,618
May I borrow it?

711
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:36,824
Go ahead, sir.

712
00:44:38,749 --> 00:44:40,660
What's this about a marriage?

713
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:42,705
I mean before Philippe.

714
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,823
You got married after leaving me?

715
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:48,343
Yes, I did it to get rid of you.

716
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:49,987
To forget you.

717
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:52,301
I was so hurt I decided

718
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,664
to marry the first man
who'd ask me.

719
00:44:55,749 --> 00:44:57,341
He was an idiot.

720
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,420
You married an idiot?
- Yes.

721
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:00,862
A blissful idiot.

722
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:04,026
I sensed it was a mistake,

723
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:05,940
but I had to do it.

724
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:07,985
It's like the man who says:

725
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:10,583
I'll marry the first girl I see.

726
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:13,460
I meant to divorce at once,

727
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:15,665
but I'd met his whole family.

728
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:17,865
I was trapped.

729
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:20,584
It took me 6 months
to get rid of him.

730
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:24,543
Then, I lived alone
until 2 years ago,

731
00:45:25,029 --> 00:45:26,508
until I met Philippe.

732
00:45:27,149 --> 00:45:29,185
He was determined,

733
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,499
he was patient and gentle.

734
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,701
He waited until I trusted him.

735
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:38,349
So you yielded
to his British charm.

736
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:43,182
A few days ago
we talked of you...

737
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:46,067
It's true, he really loves you

738
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:48,989
but I can't get over what he said:

739
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:53,387
Mathilde made a disastrous marriage
to recover from an affair...

740
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:54,788
Now, get this:

741
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:58,697
With a violent manic-depressive.

742
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:02,305
Am I the violent manic-depressive?

743
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:05,066
Is that how you talk of me?

744
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:07,538
He simplified.
He got things mixed up.

745
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:10,821
He simplified...

746
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:12,862
Simplified...

747
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:14,788
Look, Mathilde.

748
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:17,102
Let's forget it.

749
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:20,904
Look at me and listen.

750
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:25,220
Why not run away together now?

751
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:27,345
I know we can be happy.

752
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:32,183
Did you want me completely
8 years ago?

753
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:34,783
I was crazy about you,

754
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:38,062
but I'd rather have died
than let you know.

755
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:41,861
Why didn't you say so?

756
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,297
Why didn't you want the baby?

757
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:49,744
You yourself said it was impossible.

758
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:52,181
That it wasn't right.

759
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:53,543
That we should wait!

760
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,826
I hoped you'd deny it.

761
00:46:57,709 --> 00:47:00,348
You wanted a child
but not with me...

762
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,020
and you've got one now.

763
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:09,065
No, we'd better stop seeing
each other.

764
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:15,343
Take me home.
- No.

765
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:29,382
Have you got a handkerchief?

766
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:30,538
Here.

767
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:32,742
Wait... it's dirty.

768
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:34,780
I don't care.

769
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:56,345
Feeling better?

770
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:00,187
Here. Now it's really dirty.

771
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:02,428
Thanks, my darling.

772
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,505
Am I hearing right?

773
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:07,903
Yes, you're still my darling,

774
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:09,502
even if you don't care.

775
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:11,338
My darling...

776
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:06,502
Look, Bernard.

777
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:09,298
I enjoyed it,
but it was the last time.

778
00:49:35,749 --> 00:49:39,185
Dinner's ready!

779
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:44,264
Blow on it if it's too hot.

780
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,540
Is it alright?

781
00:49:49,509 --> 00:49:51,818
How was school?
- Quiet... I can't hear.

782
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:53,501
Hear what?

783
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:55,227
It's just a car.

784
00:49:57,029 --> 00:49:58,462
How was school today?

785
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,384
I'm cold.
I'll get a sweater.

786
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:03,266
I think it's in the living-room.

787
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:10,229
Finish up. Good boy.

788
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:12,618
It must be upstairs.

789
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:14,422
Yes, yes...

790
00:50:16,109 --> 00:50:17,303
Very good.

791
00:51:04,149 --> 00:51:06,583
I'm taking two hours off.

792
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,468
Are you sick?

793
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:09,902
No, I'm fine...

794
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:12,384
but I can't stay here.

795
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,027
Just get someone to replace me.

796
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:22,698
Hello.

797
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:25,826
You didn't reserve for today.

798
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,941
The 18 is taken.
I'll give you another.

799
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:30,701
Okay. Can I make a call?

800
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,541
Yes. This way.

801
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:57,467
It's me.

802
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:00,427
Where are you?
- At the hotel.

803
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:03,018
The hotel?
- Yes, our hotel.

804
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:04,264
How come?

805
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:07,785
I was driving by and I thought...

806
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:09,143
Listen, come over!

807
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,423
No, I can't.

808
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:11,868
Yes! Come on!

809
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:14,065
Remember what I said in the car.

810
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:15,747
Come anyway!

811
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:19,057
I really can't.

812
00:52:19,149 --> 00:52:20,707
You can't, or you won't?

813
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,108
Neither.

814
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:25,386
You forget we talked it all over.
It's settled.

815
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:26,908
No, it's not!

816
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:29,425
We never have enough time to talk.

817
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:30,783
How about tonight?

818
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,348
No, I can't tonight.

819
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:33,657
Is your husband back?

820
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:35,137
No. Why?

821
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:37,066
Where were you last night?

822
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:39,344
Last night? Wait...

823
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:41,499
I went to see my publisher.

824
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:43,625
You expect me to believe

825
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:45,859
you talked business all night?

826
00:52:45,949 --> 00:52:47,780
It wasn't all night.

827
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:49,348
Don't kid me!

828
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:51,420
At 8:12,
your lights were still on.

829
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:53,306
At 8:20,
you drove off in your car.

830
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:54,742
At a quarter past midnight,
the car...

831
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:57,821
I was showing Roland my drawings.

832
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:02,147
Are you still there?

833
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:04,188
Answer me.

834
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:07,425
You can't be jealous of Roland.

835
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:09,101
He's not interested in women.

836
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,304
I don't believe you.

837
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:11,822
You don't?

838
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:13,707
No, not a word of it.

839
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:16,383
I don't care.
I'm through with you.

840
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,217
You scare me!

841
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:44,747
I want you to explain.

842
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,820
Now you're scared of me?

843
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:52,060
Never mind.
I was just upset.

844
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:54,265
Is that why you hung up on me?

845
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:56,704
I hung up
because you insulted me.

846
00:53:57,069 --> 00:53:59,902
Like a cop talking to a thief.

847
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,623
Don't stay there.
Come in.

848
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:05,062
You're right...

849
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,781
Absolutely right.

850
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:10,465
With us,
it's always all or nothing.

851
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:11,538
Sit down.

852
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:14,268
No...
I'm so tired I'd fall asleep.

853
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:18,664
There's something else.

854
00:54:18,749 --> 00:54:21,741
What is it?
What did I do?

855
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:24,740
I hate lying.

856
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:29,067
Since we've been meeting
I'm living a lie.

857
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:31,946
I meant to tell Philippe everything

858
00:54:32,029 --> 00:54:34,497
but I couldn't...

859
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:37,501
I couldn't do it, either.

860
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:39,659
We can't go on like this.

861
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:43,102
Next week, we're going away.

862
00:54:43,709 --> 00:54:46,860
That too, is why I couldn't
meet you at the hotel.

863
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:51,143
Remember, you used to say to me

864
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:55,022
and it always made me miserable:

865
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:58,581
Love affairs must have a beginning,

866
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:00,944
a middle and an end.

867
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:04,618
It was true!
- You're right.

868
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:08,620
You're absolutely right!

869
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:13,543
I'll get a hold of myself.

870
00:55:13,629 --> 00:55:15,984
I won't bother you.

871
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:18,788
We'll be friends again,
like before.

872
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,147
Like before...

873
00:55:21,749 --> 00:55:23,501
Before what?

874
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,143
I'd better go home now.

875
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:44,542
I've got to go.

876
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:49,500
What if Arlette sees you?

877
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:51,063
I'll tell her that...

878
00:55:51,149 --> 00:55:53,060
That you fixed my freezer.

879
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,026
Yes. No, I'll tell her

880
00:55:55,149 --> 00:55:57,026
I'm feeling better,

881
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:58,667
that I'm breathing again.

882
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:00,788
I'm breathing.

883
00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:06,102
Here's my Thomas!

884
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,539
Wait...
I'll give you a push.

885
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:21,144
What's all this?

886
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:22,378
I'm cooking.

887
00:56:22,469 --> 00:56:24,858
No cooking tonight!

888
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:28,544
Call the baby-sister.
We're going out.

889
00:56:29,149 --> 00:56:32,027
A movie, dinner.
Tonight we celebrate!

890
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:46,379
Some coffee and a decaf...

891
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:53,186
I'm really glad to see you relaxed.

892
00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:54,827
I'm always relaxed.

893
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:56,137
No.
- Sure I am.

894
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:58,424
Not for the past few weeks.

895
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:03,541
I felt you wanted to be by yourself.

896
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:08,299
I meant to visit my mother
with Thomas

897
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:09,862
just to give you a break.

898
00:57:09,949 --> 00:57:11,428
Hell, no!

899
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:15,058
I'd really like to take time off

900
00:57:15,189 --> 00:57:16,861
and go away with Thomas,

901
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:19,179
on a real vacation.

902
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:21,263
Relax...

903
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:23,502
Look who's here!

904
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:29,304
You're here, too!

905
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:31,459
Yes, we decided to go out...

906
00:57:31,669 --> 00:57:33,739
How was it?
- Fine...

907
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:36,422
Hello, Roland.

908
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:40,664
Paris is hell on earth!

909
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:42,700
They're all so hysterical.

910
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,945
I want to face Mme Jouve.

911
00:57:51,069 --> 00:57:53,299
I'm sorry,
the chef's gone.

912
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:54,902
Then, a salad for two.

913
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:56,581
That's fine.
- Right.

914
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:59,220
He's nervous.

915
00:58:01,149 --> 00:58:02,502
Excited, what?

916
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:05,786
Whenever he sees baggage

917
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:07,939
he just goes wild.

918
00:58:08,509 --> 00:58:11,182
I see you took the night off.

919
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:13,226
We saw a movie.

920
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:14,583
Which one?

921
00:58:14,669 --> 00:58:16,227
"The Walking Dead".

922
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:17,458
It's a thriller.

923
00:58:17,549 --> 00:58:18,902
I think I saw it.

924
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:21,025
It's about a man
who's jealous...

925
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:23,304
For no reason.
His wife's an angel.

926
00:58:23,389 --> 00:58:25,300
I'm not so sure.
The other guy...

927
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:27,459
the young one,
kills the husband.

928
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,097
No!

929
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:32,749
The husband commits suicide
and makes it look like a murder.

930
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:35,502
Yes, I saw it! It's very clever.

931
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:38,342
He places the knife above

932
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:40,181
the door hinge...

933
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:41,941
He stabbed himself.

934
00:58:42,029 --> 00:58:43,462
The knife's in one room,

935
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:45,267
the body's in the other.

936
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:47,340
He knew
they'd suspect the wife.

937
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:49,667
Are you sure?

938
00:58:50,229 --> 00:58:52,504
The knife in one room,
the body in other.

939
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:54,705
He made it look like murder.

940
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:57,940
It's explained in the end.
Didn't you hear it?

941
00:58:58,029 --> 00:59:00,418
Sure, I did.
- He was asleep!

942
00:59:00,509 --> 00:59:02,625
With his eyes open.

943
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:05,662
No, no...

944
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:10,984
You need a drawing board

945
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:12,946
now that you're a pro.

946
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:15,941
Roland told me of a place
in Grenoble. Shall I get one?

947
00:59:16,029 --> 00:59:17,826
No, I'll go myself.

948
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:20,419
If this little boy was blond,

949
00:59:20,509 --> 00:59:22,500
he'd look like Thomas.

950
00:59:23,149 --> 00:59:25,026
Well, mine has dark hair.

951
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:28,426
Pictures are fascinating.

952
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:30,977
I prefer yours to mine.

953
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:34,019
I'm sorting them: School,

954
00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:38,182
high school, college.

955
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:40,225
Each one brings you
closer to me.

956
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,141
Tell me, Mathilde...

957
00:59:48,029 --> 00:59:50,224
You already knew Bernard?

958
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:02,303
Look...

959
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:05,862
You're right.
It's him.

960
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:09,741
This is the only time we met.

961
01:00:10,269 --> 01:00:12,988
My cousin was wild about him!

962
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:14,868
Here she is...

963
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:17,947
Did he love her?

964
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:21,820
Why didn't they marry?

965
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:33,507
My cousin's father doted on her.

966
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:36,828
He checked Bernard's background

967
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:38,826
and he told her:
Do as you like

968
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:43,107
but I know his kind.

969
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:45,942
Easy to get but hard to keep.

970
01:00:49,429 --> 01:00:50,862
You love me?

971
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,587
Will you always protect me?

972
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:59,502
Come, Thomas... a picture.

973
01:01:01,069 --> 01:01:03,458
Mathilde, we want you in it.

974
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:05,102
Closer!

975
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:07,787
You see, we can be friends.

976
01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:09,940
You thought we never could.

977
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:11,098
Smile!

978
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:17,137
Friends,
may I have your attention.

979
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:19,226
I'm not going to make a speech

980
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:22,506
but tell you the reason
for this party.

981
01:01:22,669 --> 01:01:25,137
In two hours,
Mathilde and I

982
01:01:25,229 --> 01:01:26,821
are going away.

983
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:28,104
You already know that,

984
01:01:28,189 --> 01:01:30,419
but you don't know

985
01:01:30,749 --> 01:01:32,387
it's a honeymoon trip.

986
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:35,900
Since we married
and settled here

987
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:38,344
we haven't had time

988
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:41,023
for the ritual honeymoon

989
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:43,828
which will consecrate
our marriage.

990
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,907
And that's what we're celebrating.

991
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:51,107
It's really great...

992
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,461
Two love birds!

993
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,347
Their plane leaves at six.

994
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:57,181
I'm taking them to the airport.

995
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:08,981
Here!
- Thanks.

996
01:02:16,509 --> 01:02:17,658
I'm beat!

997
01:02:17,749 --> 01:02:19,705
Sit down.
- No, you sit down.

998
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:23,344
Just lend me your knees.

999
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:26,308
You're radiant

1000
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:28,346
but Bernard looks miserable.

1001
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:31,061
I'd like one of you and Philippe.

1002
01:02:31,149 --> 01:02:34,346
Where is he?
- I'll go get him.

1003
01:02:39,749 --> 01:02:41,546
Never mind that, Nicole.

1004
01:02:41,629 --> 01:02:43,426
Come help me fix my dress.

1005
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:50,223
Need me?
- No, Nicole will do it.

1006
01:02:53,949 --> 01:02:57,419
I should have wrapped it around me,
like an apron. I wasn't thinking.

1007
01:03:02,749 --> 01:03:03,977
Excuse me.

1008
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:05,427
Mathilde, a call for you.

1009
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,658
For me?
- Yes.

1010
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:12,941
There's nobody...

1011
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:14,382
Yes, there's me!

1012
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:18,669
Come to the hotel, later.

1013
01:04:18,749 --> 01:04:19,864
That's impossible!

1014
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:22,304
In my car, then.
We must talk!

1015
01:04:22,389 --> 01:04:24,778
We've nothing to say
to each other.

1016
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:27,383
We never have time to talk.

1017
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:28,584
Not so loud!

1018
01:04:28,669 --> 01:04:31,342
I'll talk as loud as I want to!

1019
01:04:32,229 --> 01:04:35,266
I just ask you
not to leave tonight

1020
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:37,658
or to put off
your trip for a while.

1021
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,979
I tell you
I must speak to you!

1022
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:43,266
Let me go! You're crazy!
- What's going on? - Let go!

1023
01:04:44,429 --> 01:04:46,624
Let go!
You're crazy!

1024
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:50,065
Please, let go of me!

1025
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:54,348
Come on!

1026
01:04:55,869 --> 01:04:57,985
Let me kiss you!

1027
01:05:06,749 --> 01:05:08,307
He's crazy!

1028
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:11,661
Let go!
Let go!

1029
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:19,981
You're mad at me...

1030
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:23,941
You must hate me...

1031
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:28,146
I'm not mad.
I don't hate you.

1032
01:06:31,629 --> 01:06:34,666
You must have gone through hell

1033
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:38,179
but I can't help being jealous.

1034
01:06:39,749 --> 01:06:42,024
Jealous of her, of you,

1035
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,865
even of your suffering.

1036
01:06:46,989 --> 01:06:50,868
And you might have
trusted me enough

1037
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:53,581
to let me know.

1038
01:06:53,669 --> 01:06:57,264
What could I tell you?

1039
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:59,385
"Arlette. Our new neighbor
is the dame

1040
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:02,586
"who drove me nuts
8 years ago"?

1041
01:07:02,669 --> 01:07:03,897
Why not?

1042
01:07:09,149 --> 01:07:11,617
I thought I'd forgotten her.

1043
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:16,386
Besides, I had no idea

1044
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:19,184
we'd see them so often.

1045
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:21,942
A situation like that

1046
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:23,343
is bound to be difficult.

1047
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:27,339
It's funny,
most of the time

1048
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:31,020
she got on my nerves.

1049
01:07:31,189 --> 01:07:32,941
I don't understand it...

1050
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,828
I really don't.

1051
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:41,623
Arlette...

1052
01:07:41,869 --> 01:07:43,666
Come closer, please!

1053
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:52,938
Yes, it was Mathilde
8 years ago.

1054
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:58,708
We were no good
for each other.

1055
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:01,465
It was all a disaster...

1056
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:02,743
A disaster?

1057
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,785
Yes, a disaster...

1058
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:08,065
It seemed pointless to discuss it

1059
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:11,068
and we won't.
It's all over!

1060
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:22,697
Arlette...

1061
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:40,905
Are you sick? What is it?

1062
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,547
What's the matter?

1063
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:45,308
Guess what...

1064
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:49,378
Yes.

1065
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:26,903
You've improved
in the past few weeks.

1066
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:28,622
With Roland's help.

1067
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:34,263
But there's something else
on your mind

1068
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:36,943
Yes.

1069
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:40,863
We must make new
living arrangements.

1070
01:09:44,429 --> 01:09:45,862
I asked Mme Jouve to help us

1071
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,780
find a flat in town.

1072
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:51,300
That woman's a god-send.

1073
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:54,509
You know what she did last month?

1074
01:09:55,949 --> 01:09:58,861
A former lover of hers who lives

1075
01:09:58,989 --> 01:10:01,901
in New Caledonia,
came to see her.

1076
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,867
Well, she spent three days in Paris

1077
01:10:05,229 --> 01:10:06,821
to avoid meeting him

1078
01:10:06,909 --> 01:10:09,628
so he wouldn't see
how she's aged.

1079
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:10,903
You're wrong!

1080
01:10:11,269 --> 01:10:12,907
You're all wrong!

1081
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:16,380
That man from New Caledonia

1082
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:18,824
was Odile's only love.

1083
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:21,907
Because of him she jumped out
of a window 20 years ago.

1084
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:25,387
He never knew

1085
01:10:25,869 --> 01:10:28,258
that she's a cripple because of him.

1086
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:33,179
She's a remarkable woman,

1087
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:35,705
but he never understood it.

1088
01:10:35,789 --> 01:10:37,108
Really?

1089
01:10:37,589 --> 01:10:39,227
Well, neither did I.

1090
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:43,820
Men never understand love.
Amateurs.

1091
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:45,900
I love you,

1092
01:10:45,989 --> 01:10:47,058
but I don't understand you.

1093
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:49,982
I've never lied in my life,

1094
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:51,582
it's too complicated,

1095
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:53,660
but now,
I'm living with a liar,

1096
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,977
sleeping with a liar,

1097
01:10:55,069 --> 01:10:57,537
making love with a liar

1098
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:01,701
and I'm in love with a liar.

1099
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:53,743
Come, Mathilde...

1100
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:23,661
Tell me,
what's my name?

1101
01:12:23,749 --> 01:12:24,738
What?

1102
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:26,547
What's my name?
- Philippe!

1103
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:27,903
Right. I'm Philippe.

1104
01:12:28,029 --> 01:12:30,418
You say another name
in your sleep.

1105
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:34,826
Shall I tell you
what name you say?

1106
01:12:34,909 --> 01:12:36,058
No...

1107
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:23,500
Do you remember me?

1108
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:25,420
Sure. Room 18.

1109
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:29,497
Could I rent the room
by the month?

1110
01:13:29,589 --> 01:13:31,580
No, we only rent by the day now.

1111
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:34,627
We're reconverting to apartments.

1112
01:13:34,949 --> 01:13:36,382
Never mind.

1113
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:38,985
Please excuse me.

1114
01:14:00,509 --> 01:14:02,579
Did you reverse it by mistake?

1115
01:14:02,669 --> 01:14:05,866
The drawing belongs
on the recto page.

1116
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:09,026
Profiles towards the outside margin.

1117
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:10,098
I see...

1118
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:11,941
Do you mind?

1119
01:14:12,029 --> 01:14:13,144
I'm tired.

1120
01:14:15,149 --> 01:14:17,982
I love your handwriting.

1121
01:14:18,509 --> 01:14:20,420
If we do another book,

1122
01:14:20,509 --> 01:14:23,945
we'll print your handwriting.

1123
01:14:24,749 --> 01:14:26,740
If you like...

1124
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:30,338
Excuse me.

1125
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:32,101
It's alright.

1126
01:14:32,829 --> 01:14:35,741
We've got a problem
with the bloodstain.

1127
01:14:35,829 --> 01:14:38,024
The drawing is very good,

1128
01:14:38,109 --> 01:14:40,384
but the bloodstain is too crude,

1129
01:14:40,469 --> 01:14:42,346
too violent for young readers.

1130
01:14:42,429 --> 01:14:44,818
I worked out a variant.

1131
01:14:45,069 --> 01:14:46,297
You're wrong.

1132
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:49,468
I meant the red to stand out.

1133
01:14:49,549 --> 01:14:51,380
If not the drawing's meaningless.

1134
01:14:51,469 --> 01:14:53,346
Not really.
It's too morbid.

1135
01:14:53,429 --> 01:14:56,501
Does this variant betray
your meaning?

1136
01:14:58,109 --> 01:14:59,622
Betray...

1137
01:15:00,189 --> 01:15:01,508
I'm tired.

1138
01:15:03,549 --> 01:15:05,028
I must go.

1139
01:15:06,389 --> 01:15:08,027
I'll call you at home.

1140
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:09,178
Goodbye!

1141
01:15:31,509 --> 01:15:32,988
We'll be back soon!

1142
01:15:33,149 --> 01:15:34,298
In five minutes!

1143
01:16:03,429 --> 01:16:05,943
Hello, Thomas.
How are you? - Fine.

1144
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:08,145
I'm thirsty. May I go in?

1145
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:10,424
Sure.
- Coming?

1146
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:18,820
Can I have some water?
- Yes.

1147
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:21,785
You want some?
- No.

1148
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,143
Not thirsty?

1149
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:27,743
What a nice house.
The kitchen, too.

1150
01:16:27,869 --> 01:16:29,746
Let me see your room.

1151
01:16:30,909 --> 01:16:32,467
Will you show me?

1152
01:16:34,869 --> 01:16:37,383
You're giving me a guided tour.

1153
01:16:41,789 --> 01:16:43,222
Where's your room?

1154
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:49,298
How lovely!

1155
01:16:49,389 --> 01:16:50,947
Come see my toys!

1156
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:04,223
What are you doing?

1157
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:16,822
I like that picture.

1158
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:18,298
What is it?

1159
01:17:18,389 --> 01:17:19,947
It's a whale who's crying.

1160
01:17:20,389 --> 01:17:22,220
Why is it crying?

1161
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:23,981
It's unhappy.

1162
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:27,620
What do you know
about unhappiness?

1163
01:17:33,469 --> 01:17:35,346
Is this your first book?

1164
01:17:35,429 --> 01:17:38,944
Yes, although three years ago...

1165
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:41,020
Never mind.
It's my first.

1166
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:42,508
Your first book.
- Yes.

1167
01:17:42,589 --> 01:17:43,624
Nicole, there you are...

1168
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:47,065
Can you sign a copy
for my niece?

1169
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:49,623
I leafed through it.
It's very good.

1170
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:51,980
Almost too good for children.

1171
01:17:52,069 --> 01:17:54,742
How can you say
a thing like that?

1172
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:57,423
What's going on?

1173
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:04,229
There's a fire-extinguisher
in my car!

1174
01:18:05,709 --> 01:18:07,506
Children, go away!

1175
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:09,142
I'll help you.

1176
01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:14,504
Do you know how to use this?

1177
01:18:18,789 --> 01:18:20,859
Were you scared?
- No...

1178
01:18:20,949 --> 01:18:22,143
Wait a minute.

1179
01:18:22,909 --> 01:18:24,740
Look at you!

1180
01:18:24,829 --> 01:18:26,547
Go and wash up.

1181
01:18:26,629 --> 01:18:28,745
Just look at this mess!

1182
01:18:34,029 --> 01:18:35,587
Did you hear about Marcel?

1183
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,739
I haven't seen him lately.

1184
01:18:37,869 --> 01:18:39,939
Did he mention
his blonde neighbor?

1185
01:18:40,029 --> 01:18:42,702
Yes, he went for her
in a big way...

1186
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:45,178
At first!
Now he can't shake her.

1187
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:46,827
I don't get it.

1188
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:48,547
He keeps meeting her
in the elevator.

1189
01:18:48,629 --> 01:18:50,142
He'll have to move.

1190
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:52,265
That'll teach him.

1191
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:54,783
Never get involved
with a neighbor!

1192
01:18:55,269 --> 01:18:58,420
That Marcel!

1193
01:19:08,669 --> 01:19:10,261
Later, sir.

1194
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:54,546
Look. I'm in love!

1195
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,228
Where's Mathilde?

1196
01:19:59,309 --> 01:20:00,822
Did you see Mathilde?

1197
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:04,028
I've lost Mathilde...

1198
01:20:08,189 --> 01:20:09,827
Did you see my wife?

1199
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:12,667
I'm looking for Mathilde.

1200
01:20:20,189 --> 01:20:22,100
She's over there.

1201
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:23,702
Mathilde.

1202
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:28,789
Mathilde!

1203
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:31,538
What's wrong?

1204
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:44,907
What's wrong?

1205
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:46,947
What is it, darling?

1206
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:49,541
Answer me.

1207
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,945
Your husband's coming.

1208
01:21:08,349 --> 01:21:09,782
No...

1209
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:13,419
This can't go on.

1210
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:15,898
No, it can't.

1211
01:21:15,989 --> 01:21:17,502
You must eat.

1212
01:21:17,869 --> 01:21:19,143
You've lost weight.

1213
01:21:19,309 --> 01:21:20,742
I'm ugly...

1214
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:23,867
I'm skinny.

1215
01:21:25,429 --> 01:21:27,101
I'm garbage.

1216
01:21:29,149 --> 01:21:30,821
I want to die.

1217
01:21:36,469 --> 01:21:38,699
What's happening to me?

1218
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:41,937
Your husband will help you.

1219
01:21:42,749 --> 01:21:44,102
No...

1220
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:49,226
I want to understand.

1221
01:21:51,549 --> 01:21:53,824
I've got to understand.

1222
01:21:57,429 --> 01:21:59,385
Contrary to what people believe

1223
01:21:59,589 --> 01:22:01,659
a nervous breakdown
is a real illness.

1224
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:03,822
What's more,

1225
01:22:03,909 --> 01:22:05,979
the patient doesn't want
to get well,

1226
01:22:06,069 --> 01:22:07,343
on the contrary.

1227
01:22:14,349 --> 01:22:17,147
Your wife could go home
in a week,

1228
01:22:18,749 --> 01:22:21,309
but she prefers to be sick.

1229
01:22:21,389 --> 01:22:23,220
Right now, it's her choice.

1230
01:22:23,829 --> 01:22:25,387
What will you do?

1231
01:22:26,869 --> 01:22:30,225
I'll try to convince her

1232
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:33,428
it's useless to seek refuge
in illness.

1233
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:37,857
By the way,

1234
01:22:39,469 --> 01:22:42,381
had you noticed
this coming on?

1235
01:22:42,469 --> 01:22:43,902
No, she collapsed,

1236
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:46,259
she simply collapsed.

1237
01:22:48,349 --> 01:22:50,067
True, she was disturbed.
Last week,

1238
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:52,424
we were in downtown Grenoble.

1239
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,420
There was lots of traffic.

1240
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:55,823
She kept on saying:

1241
01:22:55,909 --> 01:22:58,548
Where are they all going?

1242
01:23:15,549 --> 01:23:17,744
I'll come get you at six...

1243
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:31,658
Bernard!
- Yes.

1244
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:35,059
I wanted to see you.

1245
01:23:35,949 --> 01:23:38,019
You know me,

1246
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:41,699
I hate interfering, but I've got
to talk to you about Mathilde

1247
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:43,905
I don't want to hear about her.

1248
01:23:43,989 --> 01:23:45,104
I'll tell you anyway.

1249
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:47,539
I went to the clinic today.

1250
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:50,302
She's in a very bad way.

1251
01:23:50,509 --> 01:23:52,864
I'm certain your visit would help.

1252
01:23:52,949 --> 01:23:55,509
You can talk to her,
reason with her.

1253
01:23:55,589 --> 01:23:58,547
The trouble is
I know her too well.

1254
01:23:58,629 --> 01:24:01,348
I'm the last person
who can help her!

1255
01:24:01,429 --> 01:24:02,623
You're wrong, Bernard.

1256
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:04,859
You got over it,
but she didn't.

1257
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:07,338
Please, don't insist.

1258
01:24:36,469 --> 01:24:37,743
Did you call me?

1259
01:24:37,829 --> 01:24:39,421
A man to see you.
- Who?

1260
01:24:39,509 --> 01:24:41,067
He wouldn't say.

1261
01:25:01,869 --> 01:25:04,667
That's the story.

1262
01:25:05,749 --> 01:25:08,786
You can do as you like.

1263
01:25:08,869 --> 01:25:12,305
But when I step into her room

1264
01:25:12,669 --> 01:25:14,660
the look on her face
makes it clear

1265
01:25:14,749 --> 01:25:17,786
it isn't me she's expecting.

1266
01:25:22,549 --> 01:25:24,062
This way, sir.

1267
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:26,628
Good evening.

1268
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:41,343
You want me to stay?

1269
01:25:45,469 --> 01:25:46,788
You want me to go?

1270
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:52,662
You don't care either way.

1271
01:25:58,389 --> 01:26:00,220
Hello, Thomas!

1272
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:06,821
Good evening.

1273
01:26:13,429 --> 01:26:15,260
Ask me why I'm late.

1274
01:26:15,589 --> 01:26:16,988
Why are you late?

1275
01:26:17,309 --> 01:26:20,221
Philippe Bauchard came to see me.

1276
01:26:20,309 --> 01:26:22,504
He insisted that I visit Mathilde.

1277
01:26:22,589 --> 01:26:24,784
She's in a clinic.
Sleep therapy.

1278
01:26:24,869 --> 01:26:27,702
Yes, I heard.
Is she any better?

1279
01:26:27,909 --> 01:26:29,262
Not really.

1280
01:26:29,789 --> 01:26:31,700
They prescribed shock treatment,

1281
01:26:31,789 --> 01:26:33,222
but Philippe objected.

1282
01:26:33,429 --> 01:26:34,908
He's right.

1283
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:39,258
It helps one forget,
but there are side effects.

1284
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:43,259
Was she pleased to see you?

1285
01:26:44,029 --> 01:26:46,497
I talked,
but she wouldn't answer.

1286
01:26:47,709 --> 01:26:49,745
I promised Philippe I'd go back

1287
01:26:50,429 --> 01:26:52,385
but I doubt whether it will help.

1288
01:26:52,829 --> 01:26:55,184
If I were you, I'd go back.

1289
01:26:55,389 --> 01:26:57,141
In such cases you never know

1290
01:26:57,229 --> 01:26:58,947
what helps.

1291
01:27:01,949 --> 01:27:03,701
She adored him.

1292
01:27:04,549 --> 01:27:07,347
When she heard
he was going away,

1293
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:09,466
she said to herself:

1294
01:27:09,749 --> 01:27:11,740
I'll wait for him.

1295
01:27:12,589 --> 01:27:15,547
Then I decided
to kill my mother!

1296
01:27:16,429 --> 01:27:17,498
What?

1297
01:27:18,749 --> 01:27:20,580
That's to see
if you're listening.

1298
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:23,339
Back to Mme Jouve.

1299
01:27:23,909 --> 01:27:26,662
When she heard
her lover had married,

1300
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:29,379
she opened the 7th floor window

1301
01:27:29,549 --> 01:27:30,948
and jumped out.

1302
01:27:31,269 --> 01:27:34,306
Luckily she landed
on a glass roof.

1303
01:27:34,789 --> 01:27:36,381
That was twenty years ago

1304
01:27:36,669 --> 01:27:39,183
and now she's a cripple.

1305
01:27:40,069 --> 01:27:41,343
Any comments?

1306
01:27:41,429 --> 01:27:43,784
I'd say the lady was lucky.

1307
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:46,706
You call that luck?

1308
01:27:46,789 --> 01:27:49,906
Yes. She was lucky to stay alive.

1309
01:27:50,189 --> 01:27:52,498
To love another man, perhaps.

1310
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:55,265
Life has more imagination
than us.

1311
01:27:55,349 --> 01:27:57,226
You know, one can love,

1312
01:27:58,749 --> 01:28:01,741
or be loved more than once.

1313
01:28:02,309 --> 01:28:04,140
Only if one is loveable...

1314
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,502
and I'm not.

1315
01:28:08,469 --> 01:28:09,584
I'm just not.

1316
01:28:11,469 --> 01:28:13,425
I seem to turn people off.

1317
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:15,779
What about your husband?

1318
01:28:17,029 --> 01:28:18,257
My husband loves me

1319
01:28:19,509 --> 01:28:20,908
but he's like you.

1320
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:23,786
He pretends he's listening.

1321
01:28:24,869 --> 01:28:26,700
He says:
Turn over a new leaf.

1322
01:28:26,789 --> 01:28:28,859
But the leaf weighs a ton!

1323
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:32,345
Nobody really cares.

1324
01:28:35,189 --> 01:28:36,827
Sure, you're payed for it!

1325
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:39,946
According to all those books

1326
01:28:40,509 --> 01:28:42,659
I should fall in love with you

1327
01:28:42,749 --> 01:28:44,467
but you leave me cold.

1328
01:28:44,549 --> 01:28:46,699
Something's wrong
with the treatment.

1329
01:29:02,389 --> 01:29:03,663
Be quiet. Don't talk.

1330
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:10,069
Instead of playing nursemaid

1331
01:29:10,149 --> 01:29:13,221
put new batteries
in my radio, there.

1332
01:29:16,469 --> 01:29:18,664
Time for your medicine.

1333
01:29:24,629 --> 01:29:27,746
These pills are just wonderful.

1334
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:31,299
This one makes you hungry.

1335
01:29:32,389 --> 01:29:35,187
This one makes you sleep.

1336
01:29:35,309 --> 01:29:38,062
I've even got one to cheer me up!

1337
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:41,186
If you take two,
you become hilarious.

1338
01:29:41,949 --> 01:29:43,098
You should try one.

1339
01:29:44,309 --> 01:29:46,027
No, thanks. I'm fine.

1340
01:29:46,229 --> 01:29:47,423
You think so?

1341
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,348
How's Mme Jouve?

1342
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:53,306
She's very well.

1343
01:30:05,309 --> 01:30:07,504
These visits give you a pain, right?

1344
01:30:07,589 --> 01:30:09,022
Not at all.

1345
01:30:10,389 --> 01:30:11,822
Not at all, but...

1346
01:30:12,389 --> 01:30:14,266
See, it's working now.

1347
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:18,308
I'm glad you want to hear the news.

1348
01:30:18,389 --> 01:30:21,586
No. I only listen to songs.

1349
01:30:22,869 --> 01:30:24,507
They tell the truth.

1350
01:30:25,829 --> 01:30:27,899
Even those that sound silly.

1351
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:29,388
Besides, they're not really silly.

1352
01:30:29,709 --> 01:30:32,223
You know what they say?
They say:

1353
01:30:33,549 --> 01:30:34,948
"Don't ever leave me.

1354
01:30:36,149 --> 01:30:37,867
"Broken-hearted me.

1355
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:41,223
"I'm lost without you, or...".

1356
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:44,827
"Let me be your shadow's shadow".

1357
01:30:45,149 --> 01:30:48,744
Or: "There is no life without love...".

1358
01:30:49,989 --> 01:30:51,342
Okay, Mathilde.

1359
01:30:53,629 --> 01:30:55,426
I've got to run now.

1360
01:30:57,509 --> 01:30:58,737
I'll be back.

1361
01:31:04,549 --> 01:31:05,982
Don't bother.

1362
01:31:06,509 --> 01:31:07,737
You don't have to.

1363
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:10,267
You can tell them:

1364
01:31:10,669 --> 01:31:11,943
Mission accomplished.

1365
01:31:12,189 --> 01:31:14,145
The nut is back to normal.

1366
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:44,904
Come home!

1367
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:50,817
Hello, Philippe.

1368
01:31:50,909 --> 01:31:51,898
Hello, Arlette.

1369
01:31:53,109 --> 01:31:55,304
Did you find a house?

1370
01:31:55,389 --> 01:31:57,664
No, a flat in town.
It's very nice.

1371
01:31:59,509 --> 01:32:01,261
How's Mathilde?

1372
01:32:01,709 --> 01:32:04,382
Much better.
She's her old self.

1373
01:32:10,269 --> 01:32:12,146
- To let -

1374
01:32:14,949 --> 01:32:18,464
Well, this is the big day.

1375
01:32:20,509 --> 01:32:23,342
I saw the doctor.
We're all set.

1376
01:32:24,869 --> 01:32:26,985
Good!
You brought the pumps.

1377
01:32:27,429 --> 01:32:28,828
My favorite shirt!

1378
01:32:28,909 --> 01:32:31,184
It's torn so I brought
the blue, too.

1379
01:32:31,269 --> 01:32:34,147
I don't care.
I prefer the white.

1380
01:32:34,909 --> 01:32:36,183
Because it's white.

1381
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:39,669
You remembered my raincoat.

1382
01:32:41,229 --> 01:32:43,379
Shall I wear the straight skirt,

1383
01:32:43,469 --> 01:32:44,948
or the pleated one?

1384
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:46,667
I like the pleated one.

1385
01:32:49,149 --> 01:32:50,707
Take me away...

1386
01:32:51,349 --> 01:32:53,146
Take me away,
my love.

1387
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:36,779
I had to speak to you...

1388
01:36:20,629 --> 01:36:21,982
Wait...

1389
01:36:39,789 --> 01:36:40,904
Come...

1390
01:37:40,309 --> 01:37:42,903
The squad car arrived at dawn.

1391
01:37:42,989 --> 01:37:46,106
The ambulance was already there.

1392
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:49,301
The medics went in
with 2 stretchers.

1393
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:51,661
The coroner's report stated:

1394
01:37:52,829 --> 01:37:56,026
We found 2 bodies,
a man and a woman.

1395
01:37:56,429 --> 01:37:58,579
The man was on top
of the woman's body.

1396
01:37:58,669 --> 01:38:00,227
His legs between hers.

1397
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:03,542
There was a bullet hole
behind his ear

1398
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:06,063
and traces of blood
on his temple.

1399
01:38:07,469 --> 01:38:09,744
An identical wound
on the woman's face

1400
01:38:09,829 --> 01:38:11,945
was made by the weapon
in her hand.

1401
01:38:12,189 --> 01:38:14,544
The woman's legs were spread.

1402
01:38:14,629 --> 01:38:17,018
Her skirt was raised
above her thighs

1403
01:38:17,509 --> 01:38:19,784
Her head was turned
towards the window.

1404
01:38:20,949 --> 01:38:23,861
The deaths occured at 5:30 a.m.

1405
01:38:23,989 --> 01:38:26,378
The position of the bodies
suggests

1406
01:38:26,469 --> 01:38:30,382
they had sex just prior
to their deaths

1407
01:39:07,789 --> 01:39:10,861
I suspect that
Mathilde and Bernard

1408
01:39:10,949 --> 01:39:12,940
won't be buried together.

1409
01:39:13,029 --> 01:39:15,941
If I had to select an epitaph
for them

1410
01:39:16,029 --> 01:39:17,701
it would be,

1411
01:39:17,789 --> 01:39:20,064
"Neither with you,
nor without you",

1412
01:39:20,149 --> 01:39:22,026
but I doubt whether
I'll be asked.
1
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:42,564
SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,638
From the Novel Down There by
DAVID GOODIS

3
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,021
I don't know how to thank you.

4
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,993
I ran into this streetlight
like an idiot.

5
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:45,324
I've gotta run.
She still waits up for me. Come on.

6
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,895
- How long you been married?
- Eleven years.

7
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,071
I wish I were married too.

8
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,668
- You say that like you mean it.
- I do.

9
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,508
It has its good points.

10
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,678
We almost didn't make it at first.

11
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,282
I'd watch her over breakfast,
wondering how to get rid of her.

12
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,650
But then I thought, "Where do you get
these ideas?" and I found no answer.

13
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,018
- A question of freedom, maybe?
- Yeah.

14
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,783
I met her at a dance.

15
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,522
Had a helluva time
getting to know her.

16
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,394
She hadn't been around much.
And you know Paris.

17
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:27,767
I'll bet there are more virgins here
than in any other city.

18
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,406
Proportionally, at least.

19
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,773
But listen -
that's not why I married her.

20
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,572
Why, then?

21
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,641
I got used to her.
We had good times.

22
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,754
I don't know you,
and we may never meet again,

23
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,258
so all the more reason
to be frank.

24
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,556
Sometimes it helps
to spill your guts to a stranger.

25
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,664
There's some truth in that.

26
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,296
I ended up having feelings for her.
First time that ever happened.

27
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,871
We went together for a year.

28
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,771
One fine day, I went out
and bought the wedding ring.

29
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,208
It always happens like that.

30
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,903
Not always.

31
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,773
I think I really fell in love with her
two years later.

32
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,211
She was in the hospital
having our first kid.

33
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,913
I remember standing
next to her bed,

34
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,219
just looking down
at her and the baby.

35
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,387
I think that's the moment
it really started.

36
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,499
How many kids you got now?

37
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,395
Three.

38
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,001
A perfect number.

39
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,672
Yeah, they're great kids.

40
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,967
I turn here,
so I'll say good-bye.

41
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,805
Take care, now.
- I sure will.

42
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,174
Thanks. And good luck!

43
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,265
CHARLIE KOLLER
DANCING NIGHTLY

44
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,293
- Hi, Edouard.
- Call me Charlie. And wait there.

45
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,859
You're a strange bird.

46
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,194
Four years since we last
saw each other,

47
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,997
and you'd think
I'd just gone around the block.

48
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,736
See this? It's so dark out,
I ran into a pole.

49
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,343
Someone after you?

50
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,344
Not the cops,
or I wouldn't get you involved.

51
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,007
So you came to get me involved?
Forget it.

52
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,091
Fido must have grown.

53
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Things okay money-wise?

54
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,130
I'm getting by.
Just don't count on me for anything.

55
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,994
I don't want to get involved,
you hear?

56
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,067
How's the family?

57
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,900
- Everyone's fine: Mom, Dad -
- Richard?

58
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,975
Oh, you know,
always up to something.

59
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,770
But we miss you and Fido,

60
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,413
so I started thinking -

61
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,674
When they started chasing you.

62
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:30,745
Charlie, you gotta help.
I'm in a real fix.

63
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,926
So you come to me!
Who's after you?

64
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,560
Two guys.

65
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,630
We pulled a job, these two guys
and Richard and me.

66
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,666
They tried to play rough
and gyp us out of our share.

67
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,806
So Richard and I kept the loot
and ditched them instead.

68
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,474
Great.

69
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,843
What do they look like?

70
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,571
One wears a hat,
the other a cap.

71
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,250
They're not brothers
but they look alike,

72
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,510
and they both smoke pipes.

73
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,436
Evening, Charlie.
How are things?

74
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,478
What the hell are you doing here?
You're throwing your life away!

75
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,341
- All right, all right.
- No, it's not all right!

76
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,517
You look great
behind that piece of junk.

77
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:36,051
You deserve a concert grand
in a packed hall

78
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,723
before a cheering crowd,
so what gives?

79
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,224
- I can't be in two places at once.
- What a laugh!

80
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,397
The world-famous artist
can't even afford a jalopy.

81
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,657
Something's screwy there.
- Okay, okay.

82
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,266
Just shut up.

83
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:53,934
Look at him, the concert pianist
pounding out honky-tonk!

84
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,803
For chrissake,
get this guy a grand piano

85
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,103
with some candlesticks!

86
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,372
Where are those candlesticks?

87
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,174
Listen, pal, pipe down!

88
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,180
I want everyone to hear.

89
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,148
They're too busy dancing.

90
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,686
That's the trouble with the world.
Nobody can be bothered.

91
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,120
Drop it, Plyne.
He's sick.

92
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,725
Who is he, pal?

93
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,862
I thought I made it clear:
Don't get chummy with me.

94
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,622
Call me mister.

95
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,562
Okay, mister, who is he?

96
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,635
Maybe my dear little brother
is ashamed of me.

97
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:30,002
He's an artist, my friend.
And his name's not Charlie.

98
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,733
It's Edouard.
- Shut up!

99
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,571
He never mentioned a brother.

100
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,475
Yep, four kids in the family,
all boys.

101
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,046
What do you pay Charlie for?

102
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,310
To play piano, of course.

103
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,081
So he's paid to play,
not spill his guts.

104
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,624
You want a guy to talk,
it'll cost you.

105
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,594
Like digging a well -
the deeper you go, the more it costs.

106
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,629
Sometimes it costs so much,

107
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,529
you just give up.

108
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,736
You're very alluring...

109
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,674
and I'm lured.

110
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,878
What luck! I just now decided
to get married.

111
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,479
You're the first one I'm asking.

112
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,052
Who says I'm single?

113
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,113
It can't be! The Abominable Snowman
there is your guy?

114
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,761
Was my guy, though we haven't
officially broken up.

115
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,589
Besides, I don't even know you.

116
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,288
- Charlie's big brother.
- No kidding.

117
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,794
I just love Charlie.

118
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,560
And how about me?

119
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,762
It's too soon to tell.

120
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,974
You'll have to excuse me.
I've got customers.

121
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,541
Is my chest that exciting?

122
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,114
- You bet. I'm a doctor.
- Sure you are.

123
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,060
Not the best crowd tonight.

124
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,928
The other night
was first-class quality.

125
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,000
Look at that!

126
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,165
Interesting.

127
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,398
Or just bizarre.

128
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,852
See you later, Charlie.

129
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,828
- Christ, they're here!
- It's your problem.

130
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,624
- I'm done for!
- The back door! Go!

131
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,138
The dame was named Frances

132
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:50,876
We all called her

133
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,482
The Raspberry

134
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,845
The sergeant was to blame

135
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,384
He was lame

136
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,551
In the brain

137
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,883
She served beer in a bar

138
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,793
Not far from the Loire

139
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,188
A tart, she was not

140
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,385
Beer was all we got

141
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,564
You'd have to have cheek

142
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,857
To pinch her cheek

143
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,158
She was right from Antibes

144
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,664
What a blight!

145
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,996
A blight on the Berry

146
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,100
That's fate, tit for tat

147
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,439
She was native Antibean

148
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,934
Closer than Carribean

149
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,739
Closer than Caracas

150
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:22,845
Or the Congo?

151
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:23,981
I don't know

152
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,978
The barrier of language

153
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,312
My ardors assuaged

154
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,847
The wench, she knew French

155
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,115
Her eyes, they sizzled

156
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,348
My passion, it fizzled

157
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,753
I'm anti-Antibean

158
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,984
Despite myself

159
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,321
What a blight!

160
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,722
A blight on the Berry

161
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,793
That's fate, tit for tat

162
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,398
Her measurements were meager

163
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,764
No wonder she was eager

164
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,232
To be adding extra padding

165
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,601
At the Beauty Institute

166
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,673
Ah! Ah! Ah!

167
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,103
By the Loire are beauticians

168
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,846
Who can add to your bosom

169
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,106
No surgical dangers

170
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,340
In Angers

171
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,518
For old gents and pretty maids

172
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,913
Attributes are custom-made

173
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,052
But for those who can't rejuvenate

174
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,346
What a blight!

175
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,751
A blight on the Berry

176
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,983
That's fate, tit for tat

177
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,895
Seeing her new measurements

178
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,190
Added to my torments

179
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,588
Ogling her plunging neckline

180
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,734
I gave her the old line

181
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,567
"Permit me to keep abreast

182
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,104
Of what's on your chest"

183
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,841
She ran away like a stranger

184
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,204
So I quit

185
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,379
I'm not fit for a dog

186
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,604
In a manger

187
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,940
The moral

188
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,242
A blight on tit for tat

189
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,676
And dame's fate is the berries!

190
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,988
They must have gone
out the alley.

191
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,460
They didn't look like killers.
Just wanted to talk business.

192
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,462
You can guess what kind.

193
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,626
When your brothers get mixed up in
something, big dumb Chico takes the fall.

194
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,398
Come on, wish him good luck
while there's still time.

195
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,098
Good luck.

196
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,753
Good night.

197
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,768
She's really got her eye on you.

198
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,096
Who does?

199
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,796
LÈna.
Thought you'd like to know.

200
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,033
Thanks anyway.

201
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,768
Too bad you're not interested.

202
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,109
I wish she looked at me like that.

203
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,445
If I'm in the way, I can leave.

204
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,582
Don't worry.
I'm not her type.

205
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,379
In fact,

206
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,783
I'm nobody's type.

207
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,355
See you tomorrow.

208
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,023
Come now.

209
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,959
I'm just a big lug,

210
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,397
and too dumb
to make women forget it.

211
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,695
Could it be glands?

212
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,702
No, it's not my glands.
Just my ugly mug.

213
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,438
Don't be afraid of women.
They're not poisonous.

214
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,143
You don't really believe that.

215
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,873
I can see you've been
through the wringer too, my boy.

216
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,142
So what?

217
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,751
I bet I even know what's eating you.

218
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,157
You're shy and scared.

219
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,223
Scared?

220
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,088
That's right.

221
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,387
Scared.

222
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,059
I'm scared.

223
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,093
Shit, I'm scared!

224
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,098
You okay, pal?

225
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,134
I'm scared.

226
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,012
Who were those two guys?

227
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,410
No idea.

228
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,148
I'm going to bed.
Life goes on, after all.

229
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,883
Hey, Mr. Charlie.

230
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,899
I didn't want anyone else to hear.

231
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,000
Can you lend me some dough
until tomorrow?

232
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,169
Sure.

233
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,402
Here.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,406
Walk with me a ways.

235
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,636
I don't like walking home
alone at night, Mr. Charlie.

236
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,549
Just call me Charlie.

237
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,411
Okay. Then you call me LÈna.

238
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,918
Why LÈna?

239
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,115
From HÈlËne to HÈlÈna
to just LÈna.

240
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,954
It'll look odd ifyou don't talk.

241
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,155
Say something, anything,
or she'll think you're scared.

242
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:11,234
She's no fool. She knows silence
and romance go hand-in-hand.

243
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,498
She's the quiet type.
Not stuck-up - just serious.

244
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,767
No cheap jokes for her.

245
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,309
It'd take something really funny
to make her laugh.

246
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,712
What's so funny?

247
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,178
That face!

248
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,749
Listen.

249
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,616
You know those guys after your brother?
- No, why?

250
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,018
I think they're following us.

251
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,715
Look here.

252
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,967
Where'd they go?

253
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,437
They must have taken off
that way.

254
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,072
Lousy luck!

255
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,805
So long.
I'm going home.

256
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,144
Come on.

257
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:03,417
She felt you against her,
but she didn't move away.

258
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,852
So she's willing -
but to do what?

259
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,355
Who knows?

260
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,551
Suggest getting a drink
to buy some time.

261
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,424
Don't mess this up.
Take it easy.

262
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,861
"We can't just say good-bye.
Let's have a drink. "

263
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,728
No, more subtle.

264
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,130
"I bet you 're thirsty. Me too. "

265
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,003
Want to get a drink -

266
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,639
Probably just as well.

267
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,210
Think of something else.
Is Art Tatum talented?

268
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,406
Or Errol Garner?
Yes, Garner's got talent.

269
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,381
Or Juno Manse? You can't say.
You don't even know him.

270
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,214
It's me - Clarisse.

271
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,792
Evening, Charlie.

272
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,897
You still sleep in the raw?

273
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,905
It's better for you.

274
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,308
Reminds me of my skeleton number
at the carnival.

275
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,175
My first gig
after running away from home.

276
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,747
I lay inside a coffin,
practically naked,

277
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,284
and with a flick of the mirrors,
you could see my skeleton.

278
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,456
Even doctors fell for it.

279
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,623
Then I sprained an ankle.

280
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,225
It's tough being an artist.

281
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,725
- Want me to stay?
- I don't know.

282
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,761
- I'll put it on your tab.
- No, thanks.

283
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,032
Okay, I won't insist.

284
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,196
I'm going.

285
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,095
Don't be sore.

286
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,235
Take off that pretty dress.

287
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,875
Close Fido's door.

288
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,908
Isn't all of me pretty?

289
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,411
It's a good working dress.

290
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,016
I don't have to bow and scrape
for customers.

291
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,243
"How much?"

292
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,251
"Three thousand.
Take it or leave it. "

293
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,221
I don't push the goods on anyone.
It's a free country.

294
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,055
I'll go behind here.
- Right. I might get ideas.

295
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,391
I prefer pretty clothes
to the sexy ones some girls wear.

296
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,693
Aren't my clothes always pretty?

297
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:04,960
Very.

298
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,901
No, really. Very pretty.

299
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,706
The girls always ask
where I buy them.

300
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,971
Pretty, aren't they?
400 francs - a bargain.

301
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,910
What do I know
about your panties?

302
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,777
Are you nuts?

303
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,475
No, just a prude.

304
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,084
A prude?

305
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,586
More like a prune!

306
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,021
Good one, huh?

307
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,059
Is pussycat hurt?
Is my pussycat mad?

308
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,928
Pussycat's not mad, just tired.

309
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,901
I even saw it on TV:
Pussycats are tired these days.

310
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,940
I'm sleepy,
and I prefer old-fashioned undies.

311
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,244
TV is like a movie theater

312
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,142
You can go to right at home

313
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,107
Move over.

314
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,023
This is how it's done
in the movies.

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,831
I saw Torpedoes in Alaska
at the movies this afternoon.

316
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,935
Any good?

317
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,902
John Wayne showing how
the USA only wants peace.

318
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,199
Well, well.
The Yanks are just like me.

319
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,934
You making fun of me?

320
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,306
I'd never do that, baby.

321
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,909
Give me a drag.

322
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,493
Hey, I thought
you were the shy type!

323
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,629
You never heard?
Shy people can be bold too.

324
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,097
Clarisse, back to your room.
Fido's gonna wake up. Quick!

325
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,239
Sure, I'm only fit to cook him
dinner every night.

326
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,880
Don't start that.
Pass me my trousers.

327
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,123
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

328
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,360
Zip me up, will you?

329
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,365
Go on home.
See you tonight.

330
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,099
Fido.

331
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,678
Time to get up.

332
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,479
Hurry up.
You'll be late.

333
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,793
Bye, Charlie.
See you tonight.

334
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,272
- Hello, Charlie.
- Have I had the pleasure?

335
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,009
I'm Ernest. He's Momo.

336
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,878
We'll give you a lift.
- I'll walk.

337
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,021
No need for that.

338
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,283
- Just to show him.
- He already knows.

339
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,223
- Maybe he's not sure.
- All right.

340
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,794
Coming with us now?
- Yeah, now I am.

341
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,971
- What do you think of our pal, Momo?
- He looks tough. You?

342
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,843
Me too.
We think you're tough.

343
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,754
Is 50,000 enough?
Give us a figure.

344
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,650
I don't need much money.

345
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,224
- Maybe he thinks we don't have it.
- Right. Show him the package.

346
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,789
Not very smart
carrying that much around.

347
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,939
Enough talk.
Where were we?

348
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,733
He refused the money.
Let's try something else.

349
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,207
Look, we only want to talk to him.
We won't hurt him.

350
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,140
Who?

351
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,443
I thought we agreed to be up front!
You know we mean your brother!

352
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,519
Put us in touch with him.
Take us to the farm.

353
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,486
- He could be away.
- I doubt it.

354
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,187
Momo, get in back.
Here's our mutual friend.

355
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,296
The waitress.
"Mrs. Charlie," you might say.

356
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,704
No need for introductions, eh?

357
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,899
- Where are we going?
- Ask your boyfriend.

358
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,273
- He's not my boyfriend.
- We're paying his brother Chico a visit.

359
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,380
That man with the black eye?

360
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,517
They've done their homework.
First they find out he's my brother.

361
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,447
Then they get our addresses.

362
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,248
- How?
- I think I know how.

363
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,582
We'll tell you.

364
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,390
We had a drink
with your boss this morning.

365
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,655
The ugly ape made us pay
through the nose.

366
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,766
Fifty smackers.

367
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,528
Twenty-five for Charlie's address,
25 for hers.

368
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,432
He's a greedy, suspicious slob.

369
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,939
What a mug -
and how he stroked that wad!

370
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,702
Plyne, the fat pig!

371
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,242
- Ernest, watch the road!
- Who's driving here?

372
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,143
You are! But be careful!

373
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,912
True. We must keep
our charming hostages safe.

374
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,782
You had time to pass that car!

375
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,857
He's waiting for you to pass.
- Do you mind?

376
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,153
- If I had the wheel!
- Around your neck?

377
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,694
- Don't get excited.
- I'm not.

378
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,199
If there's one thing I can do,

379
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,131
it's drive a car.

380
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,966
I can make a car
do anything I want.

381
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,665
- Except pass.
- You want me to blow my top?

382
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,209
No, just keep your eyes on the road
and stop ogling the chicks.

383
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,881
You'll kill someone
one of these days.

384
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,950
Fitting vengeance for my father.

385
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,144
He got run over
crossing the street.

386
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,517
He was watching the women,
not the cars.

387
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,217
Got his eye on a short skirt,
and down he goes.

388
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,364
- The old guy was a dirty old man!
- I must take after him.

389
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,160
I've got an eye for the moment

390
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,566
the wind's gonna lift a skirt,
or some nice legs gonna board a bus.

391
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,571
Do I shock you?
- Not at all.

392
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,141
I've met bastards before.
I'm learning something.

393
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,505
I tell you:

394
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,511
No matter what women say,
they all want it.

395
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,047
Want what?

396
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,617
It's just like he says:
They all want it.

397
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,186
And I say let 'em have it!

398
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,823
- But I've got nothing against women.
- I can see that.

399
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,928
I love 'em all,
precisely for what they are.

400
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,998
But they insist on talking before
and especially after,

401
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,761
just when a man
wants out of there, alone.

402
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,635
If I may, on the subject of women,
my father used to say,

403
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,902
"If you've seen one,
you've seen 'em all. "

404
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,159
When I first lay eyes on a woman,
it's like a thunderbolt.

405
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,423
I'm in love.
I want marriage, babies.

406
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,592
But once they start gabbing,
I just want to lay 'em

407
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,862
and leave 'em.

408
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,802
- Nice attitude.
- Sorry, it's just how I am.

409
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:34,638
I gotta say, you do everything
to get us males excited.

410
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,711
Why the lipstick, the nail polish,

411
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,644
the tight-fitting bras,
the short skirts?

412
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,648
Why the high heels?
Why wear stockings?

413
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,377
Why not wear socks, like us?

414
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,988
Yeah, a girl looks great
in kneesocks.

415
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,091
A real tease!

416
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,988
Once all my underwear was dirty,

417
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,164
so I tried on my sister's silk panties.
What a feeling!

418
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,492
No wonder they always want it!

419
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,931
We men wear pants,

420
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,800
but in their dresses,
their thighs are always touching.

421
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,773
It must be torture for priests.
Right, lovebirds?

422
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,446
Priests wear long drawers,
jerk face.

423
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,480
The light's red, damn it!

424
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,496
Now we're done for!
We'll do the talking, okay?

425
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,222
Open up!

426
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,561
The door!
Help me, damn it!

427
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,704
Anything wrong, Officer?

428
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,370
Turn off the engine and get out.

429
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,312
I can explain.

430
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,106
Your papers.

431
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,509
He's an awful driver, Officer.

432
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,850
He goes crazy in traffic.

433
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,848
Coming, dear?
We've had enough.

434
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,788
Let's catch a bus.

435
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,986
- Don't look at me!
- So long, Charlie!

436
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,425
See you later.

437
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,999
- Sure, drop by. We'll be waiting.
- See you soon!

438
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,846
- "See you soon," they said.
- Don't worry about it.

439
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,020
Don't worry. Right.

440
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,190
And I suppose those were
cap pistols they had too.

441
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,559
She took your arm
just like that.

442
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,859
My God, she's taking you
to her place.

443
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,593
This way.

444
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,769
Let me lead the way.

445
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,742
Don't stare at her legs.
It isn't proper.

446
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,672
Watch the steps or you'll fall.

447
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,779
Or look at the walls,
though they're pretty cruddy.

448
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:59,046
Now Charlie plays the piano at Plyne's,
but there was a time when he didn't.

449
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,218
Isn't that right, Edouard?

450
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,718
There was a time...

451
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,525
There was a time...

452
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,736
Excuse me.

453
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,006
Do you have caramel custard?
- No, it's crossed off the menu.

454
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,005
- So I see.
- Check, please.

455
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,441
- Too bad.
- Excuse me.

456
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,052
- What time are you off?
- I'll have a look.

457
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,585
Miss, please!

458
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,589
Coffee, sir?

459
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,157
Here.
Take this for your trouble.

460
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,392
It's too beautiful.

461
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,195
But you thought to yourself,
"Not for two years of happiness. "

462
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,439
We never accept gifts
from customers, sir.

463
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,718
- Has that guy been coming long?
- The last few days.

464
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,254
I've seen him somewhere before.

465
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,725
You know what I'd like?

466
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,895
Quit your job at the restaurant.
- Your piano lessons aren't exactly -

467
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,294
Don't make fun
of my piano lessons.

468
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,664
You used to like them.
- It's true. Remember?

469
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,705
"Mr. Edouard, perhaps I could learn.
I know I'm slow, but -"

470
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,240
"Don't say that, miss.
You're not slow at all.

471
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,775
It's just that the piano -"

472
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,278
"I just love my lessons.
They take up all my afternoons. "

473
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,282
"You really like the piano, miss?"
"Oh, yes, Mr. Edouard. "

474
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,721
Tell me.

475
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,753
You really want me around
all the time?

476
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,657
It's more than that.
Much more.

477
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,758
I know,
and I feel the same way.

478
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,033
It gets stronger every day.

479
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,769
I recommend the special.

480
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,441
Allow me to introduce myself:
Lars Schmeel, impresario.

481
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,310
- Edouard Saroyan.
- I remember.

482
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,817
You're a pianist.
You came to see me a year ago.

483
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:11,989
That's right.

484
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,991
I was too busy to give you much time.
Forgive me.

485
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,060
- I understand.
- Life can be crazy.

486
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,130
May I?
- Be my guest.

487
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,262
Would the gentlemen
care to order?

488
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,563
I should explain:
This is my wife.

489
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,002
Nice to meet you, little lady.

490
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,507
We play this little game
of waitress and customer.

491
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,579
A splendid game -
you both win!

492
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,782
You're very lucky, my friend.

493
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,009
You're very kind.

494
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,782
Let me redeem myself.
Come to my office tomorrow.

495
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,515
With whom did you study?

496
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,284
Old Zeleny.

497
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,335
- What are you sulking about?
- I'm not.

498
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,909
Yes, you are.
You were in a good mood in the car.

499
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,444
Then you suddenly stopped talking
as if I'd said something.

500
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:01,277
It's nothing you said.
I just realized you weren't listening.

501
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,750
You pretend to, but you don't care.
"He's talking away, so he's happy. "

502
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,720
You're thinking about tablecloths,
furniture, dressmakers.

503
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,393
I'm telling you
what I liked about the concert,

504
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,530
when I catch your look that says,
"Keep talking, buddy!"

505
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,925
I'm not done!

506
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,499
I'm fed up, you hear me?
This is no life for an artist.

507
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,797
Maybe I'm not a real artist,
but people gotta believe in me

508
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:26,033
so I can become one.
I'm not asking for much, damn it!

509
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,772
Think it doesn't take all the patience
I've got to live with you?

510
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,246
And the brilliant conversation
you make.

511
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,251
Mention Hemingway and it's
"I hear he has all my records. "

512
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,116
"So-and-so didn't like
my last recital. "

513
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,951
"Smith told Jones
I was the tops. "

514
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,127
"Should I accept this offer,
decline that one?"

515
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,627
"What's John Doe think of me?"
"Did the concierge see me on TV?"

516
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,327
My God, you repeat
everything ten times.

517
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,300
I have to act
like I've never heard it before.

518
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,773
You think this is
any sort of life?

519
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,376
Isn't it getting to be a bit much?

520
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,841
I'd rather you were more smug,

521
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,541
more sure of your talent.

522
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,948
At least I'd have some peace.

523
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,555
The slightest criticism
crushes you.

524
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,954
Forgive me.
It's just my jealousy talking.

525
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,894
No, everything you say is true.

526
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,297
I think about it too,
but what can I do?

527
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,563
I'm not the guy for you.
- Don't say that.

528
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,901
It hurts too much.

529
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,888
You lucky stiff! What a triumph!
You and your wife must be ecstatic.

530
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,959
But your press conference
was a total flop.

531
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,425
Reporters come running
to see the rare bird,

532
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,226
but they can't get
a word out of you.

533
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,995
Shyness is a disease.
It can be cured.

534
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:05,039
Luckily, I'm doing your work for you.
Look here in the gossip pages.

535
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,205
"Lars Schmeel,
Saroyan's manager, told us,

536
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,315
'I love beauty in all,
regardless of gender. "'

537
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,311
HOW TO CONQUER SHYNESS

538
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,845
HOW I GOT OVER MY FEAR

539
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:13,837
Now, Edouard,
you'll never escape from me again,

540
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,946
thanks to this masterpiece
that I can contemplate every day.

541
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,976
How's ThÈrÈsa?
- Tired.

542
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,623
She's always tired.
- Too much travel? Life on the road?

543
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,622
- No, it's me.
- Do you two argue?

544
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:33,763
We used to, in the beginning.
Now it's much more serious.

545
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,525
You can tell me everything.

546
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,565
- She's through with me.
- Come, now.

547
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:50,236
You don't believe it.
I couldn't either at first.

548
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,811
It's like she's struggling
with something.

549
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,552
I can tell.

550
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,614
For example, we'll be talking,

551
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,384
when suddenly she turns
and walks out of the room.

552
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,160
If I try to stop her, she locks herself
in her room and doesn't answer.

553
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,899
That's where things stand.
It's over.

554
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,764
- Did she tell you that?
- She didn't have to.

555
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,601
I think she began to despise me
when I became successful.

556
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,939
I think it's all a misunderstanding.

557
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,777
Bring her to the cocktail reception
later and I'll talk to her.

558
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,714
I'll try.

559
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:58,307
Listen, I've come to take you
to the party.

560
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,178
Please leave me alone.
Go away.

561
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,012
I've had enough!

562
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,088
Why are you shouting at me?
You never used to.

563
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,450
I didn't mean to.

564
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,460
It's all right.
After all, you can shout if you like.

565
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,692
I'm making you unhappy, aren't I?

566
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,092
I know it's wrong,
but I can't help myself.

567
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,573
Lost in the night, you can't stop
the shadows from closing in.

568
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,470
It gets darker and darker.

569
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,142
There's no way out.
You don't know what to do.

570
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,741
I think there's
only one thing I can do.

571
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,510
Say good-bye and go.

572
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:42,986
All right, I'll tell you.

573
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,218
You must know.

574
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,920
It's better to tell...
to confess.

575
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,863
Confess?

576
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,533
I made a mistake.

577
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,564
I did a terrible thing.

578
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,934
But now you're a famous pianist,
and I'm glad.

579
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,977
I gave you your chance.

580
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,477
Lars Schmeel.

581
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:12,046
It was a few days
before you signed the contract.

582
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,347
He came to the restaurant.

583
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,291
Not for coffee.

584
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,723
Not for lunch either.

585
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,065
To make a business proposition.

586
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,502
At first I don't understand.

587
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,130
It's like some kind of riddle.

588
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,672
I ask him what he means.

589
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,802
He looks at me as if to say,

590
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,141
"You don't get it? Think about it.
You'll figure it out. "

591
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,580
I lay awake all night
thinking about it.

592
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,948
He came back the next day.

593
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,487
You know how a spider works?

594
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,796
It was like
he'd cut me in two.

595
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,369
As if my heart were one thing
and my body another.

596
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,737
It wasn't ThÈrÈsa
who went with him.

597
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,736
Just her body,

598
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,044
as if I wasn't there.

599
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,580
I was with you.

600
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,880
I was leading you
onto the concert stage.

601
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,152
He'd rented a room
near the restaurant that afternoon.

602
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,022
Then one evening
you tell me the news:

603
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,065
The contract is signed.

604
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,394
Afterward, when he came
to the restaurant,

605
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,806
he was a customer
like any other...

606
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,937
ordering a meal.

607
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:45,608
I thought, "That's over and done with.
Now you can be ThÈrÈsa again. "

608
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,712
But it's strange.

609
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,749
What you did yesterday
stays with you today.

610
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,527
I look in the mirror.

611
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,654
Do I see ThÈrÈsa?
Your ThÈrÈsa?

612
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,429
There's no ThÈrÈsa...

613
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,369
anywhere.

614
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,376
Just a dirty old rag.

615
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,845
That's why I won't
let you touch me.

616
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,754
Not this filth!

617
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,986
Go to her, bow your head,
get down on your knees.

618
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,493
Quick, before it's too late,
think fast!

619
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,928
If you walk out that door,
she'll be all alone. Don't do it!

620
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:00,516
Wl FE OF FAM ED PIAN IST
PLUNGES TO HER DEATH

621
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,997
You disappeared
and started over.

622
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,798
Edouard Saroyan
became Charlie Koller.

623
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,765
You visited your brothers in the snow
and asked them to let you have Fido.

624
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,837
One day you ended up at the bar.

625
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,140
They were happy to have you
sweep out the old dive.

626
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,745
There was a beat-up wreck
of a piano in the corner.

627
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:28,850
You couldn't stop looking at it,
looking away, looking back again.

628
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,115
One day you asked Plyne -

629
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,416
M ind if I play a bit?

630
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,653
- You?
- I think I can play it.

631
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,760
All right.
But it better be music.

632
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,065
Who is Charlie Koller?

633
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,465
All we know is
he's the piano man

634
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,406
who's raising his kid brother
and who minds his own business.

635
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,446
Your music brings in the locals
every night, and the joint takes off.

636
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,879
Plyne hires more help
and musicians.

637
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,883
Victor, on drums,
grins all the time for no reason.

638
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:42,752
His brother, FranÁois, is on bass,
with his long, hairy hands.

639
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,484
And then there was me,

640
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,129
watching you the whole time,
but you never noticed.

641
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,480
On my birthday, when I said,
"Everyone gets a big kiss, "

642
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,990
it was so I could kiss you.

643
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,687
I saw you looking at me...

644
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,227
so I looked back.

645
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,207
What were you thinking last night,
walking me home?

646
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,602
Did you like me
right from the start?

647
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,114
Remember that night you told me -

648
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:20,915
When I took your arm, I was afraid
you'd think I was too forward.

649
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,894
I wanted so badly
for you to take my hand.

650
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:11,097
You know, I've got a feeling
Plyne is crazy about you.

651
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,673
You're nuts!
That's all I need!

652
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,674
It's true.
He told me so himself.

653
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,747
After all,
he's a man like any other.

654
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,376
I love you because
you aren't like the others.

655
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,351
You don't play the ladies' man
or the tough guy.

656
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,690
You're shy.
You respect woman.

657
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,951
Don't you believe it.

658
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,327
Deep down
I'm just like the others.

659
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:40,126
When I was rich and famous and
women recognized me in the street,

660
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,397
I'd stare at them shamelessly,
as if wanting to undress them.

661
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,706
Since most of them stared back
and seemed to enjoy it,

662
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,038
I got bolder and bolder.

663
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:55,009
But if it was a decent girl
and she looked away,

664
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,283
I felt ashamed.

665
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,617
I'd never let anyone treat my mother
or wife or daughter like that.

666
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,866
Where there's a will, there's a way.
We'll go quit Plyne's place.

667
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,435
We'll be free
and work as a team!

668
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,971
I'm going to wake you up.
You'll be Edouard Saroyan again.

669
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:19,776
What for?

670
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,709
Not what for - who for.

671
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,542
For me and you.
For us.

672
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,218
I was an orphan.
I'm used to fighting.

673
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,620
You'll work, audition,
give concerts.

674
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,783
Charlie's dead!
Long live Edouard!

675
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:45,694
Be an angel
and go buy me a pair of stockings.

676
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,637
Then we'll go
tell off that swine Plyne.

677
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,240
Get "Scandals" in size two.

678
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,875
Tangerine's my shade.

679
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,455
All I ask of a man
is to tell me when it's over.

680
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,226
Not one ever has.

681
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,268
When you don't love me anymore,
tell me.

682
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,601
Wait, I'll fix your eggs.

683
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,372
I don't like the white,
just the yolk.

684
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,414
There's a customer for you,
Miss Clarisse.

685
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,249
Why doesn't he come
during working hours?

686
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,618
Tell him to find someone else.

687
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,687
The sidewalk's full of 'em.
What nerve!

688
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,660
He insists on you.
He made that very clear.

689
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,825
He's clean and well-dressed.
A nice-looking man.

690
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,999
All right, I'm on my way.

691
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:34,337
There's sugar, yogurt and fruit.
I'll be back in a flash.

692
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,412
This is the gentleman.

693
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,274
I'll be right back, Fido.

694
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,277
Hello, miss.
Where do we go?

695
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:45,250
This way, honey. You look familiar.
Haven't you been up before?

696
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,717
No, miss.

697
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,084
- You have money?
- A little.

698
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,658
Hey, honey, where are you going?

699
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:03,003
Damn it! What's going on?

700
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,197
- Ernest!
- I'm coming.

701
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,309
Fido, don't go with them!

702
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,178
Damn you!

703
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,288
Filthy creeps!

704
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,849
Kidnappers!

705
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,098
My carriage.

706
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,743
- So we're really quitting?
- Don't get cold feet.

707
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,913
Let me handle it.
Just watch Plyne.

708
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,679
Here they are.

709
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,549
- Think you're on vacation or what?
- I got up late.

710
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,451
And then we took a drive,
and then we took a walk.

711
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,750
Together?

712
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,257
Yes, together.
You want a diagram?

713
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,227
Why not? I'm curious.
He's usually by himself.

714
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,764
Even with someone else around,
he's by himself.

715
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,335
We came for our pay.
And by the way, we're quitting too.

716
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,766
That's all I need.

717
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,703
Crap from the customers,
and now from the help too!

718
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,103
Did you hear that?

719
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,305
Charlie,
where you been hiding out?

720
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,483
I looked everywhere for you. Those
two guys last night got me worried.

721
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:24,882
Where could he hide?
They had his address, and mine too.

722
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,316
I know nothing about this.

723
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,983
Ask this joker you live with.

724
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,955
You call this living?

725
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,186
- Shut your traps, both of you!
- You shut yours!

726
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:37,799
Those guys came here this morning
and shelled out for our addresses.

727
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,726
You sold them?

728
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,836
Meet Plyne,
the double-crosser!

729
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,528
It wasn't like that.

730
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,709
Plyne's been a bastard,
but she's torturing him.

731
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,845
He sees her every day
and wants her, but not a chance.

732
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,947
Even now, she's laying into him,
but he can't tear his eyes away.

733
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,242
She's going too far,
but what can I tell her?

734
00:55:55,452 --> 00:56:00,014
That's he's not so bad?
A poor slob who never got anywhere?

735
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,415
It's all true,
but there's no point.

736
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,389
It's none of your business.
Nothing is.

737
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,496
Just take your place
at the piano.

738
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,996
You can't help Plyne
or anybody else.

739
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,500
You 're out of it now.
For you, nothing matters anymore.

740
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,184
- T ake back what you said.
- Screw you!

741
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,689
Feel my muscles, LÈna.
I'm not just anybody.

742
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,724
This is bullshit!

743
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,658
She's right.
It's bullshit!

744
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,426
"Screw you," "bullshit" -
such filth from such a lovely mouth.

745
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,264
Why don't you keep yours shut,
you fat pig!

746
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,440
As sure as you see me here,
I'm gonna kill you.

747
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,769
- I don't see you. You're too short.
- Your loss, you bitch!

748
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,570
Charlie, you sleep-walking?

749
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,749
Just leave her alone.

750
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:03,112
Okay, sure.
It's you I'm after now anyway.

751
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,718
You bastard,
you touched her!

752
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,358
Admit you defiled her.
I'll break your neck!

753
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,028
Let's stop this.

754
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,157
You're not angry?

755
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,592
- Let's forget it.
- No way.

756
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,934
Someone must win.
- Say I chickened out.

757
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,366
No, the ladies saw me run out.

758
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,205
I can't back down now.
I've got to show them.

759
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,501
I don't want people believing
everything she said.

760
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:09,908
I don't love LÈna anymore.
She used words unworthy of her.

761
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,745
If she had a soul,
she wouldn't have been so vulgar.

762
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,892
She's a slut!

763
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,188
She's not a girl,
she's not a woman.

764
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:24,492
A woman is pure,
delicate, fragile.

765
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,693
Woman is supreme.
Woman is magic.

766
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,870
To me, woman has always
been supreme.

767
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,905
Charlie boy -
sorry for getting familiar -

768
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,772
but Charlie boy,
you're about to die!

769
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,225
Go back inside.
It was just an accident.

770
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,649
- Someone's there!
- Shit, I forgot the light!

771
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,376
Must be the police.
I'll go.

772
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,782
Look, his eyes are open.

773
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,983
Move.

774
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,453
Don't push. I've got legs.

775
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,998
Then use them.
You're worse than a drunk.

776
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:43,502
I dropped the knife to show him
I wasn't serious.

777
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,165
Then he started choking me.

778
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,869
I found the knife and meant
to nick his arm to make him let go.

779
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,347
He moved
and caught it in the back.

780
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,811
- Wanna bet?
- On what?

781
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,852
- They'll buy it.
- No, the police will want proof.

782
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,148
It was me.
They won't look any further.

783
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,724
- You can explain.
- Sure - by mail.

784
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,293
Go get Fido
before the cops get there.

785
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,942
Fido!

786
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,746
- What do you want?
- You scared me!

787
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:31,784
Sorry.
I'm looking for Fido Saroyan.

788
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:36,049
Fido's gone!
Those two bastards kidnapped him!

789
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,453
You're drunk!

790
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,563
Damn those dogs!

791
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:55,141
- Fido sounds like a dog's name.
- It means "faithful. "

792
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,744
The milk trick was good,
but we won the second round.

793
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,972
Here's a tip:
Never leave the door open.

794
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:04,347
My pop used to say, "If someone
knocks, assume it's a murderer.

795
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,351
If it's just a robber,
you'll be happy. "

796
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,046
- How's school?
- So-so.

797
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,555
- What's your best subject?
- Natural science.

798
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,127
I was no good in any subject.
Work gives me a migraine.

799
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,798
I'm making up for all my ancestors
who overworked,

800
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,490
all those generations
of hard-working men.

801
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:20,633
Here.

802
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,202
Thanks. I prefer snuff.

803
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,373
You put tobacco up your nose?
Disgusting.

804
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:29,307
It's great, especially in the morning.
The first pinch is always the best.

805
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,573
- What's that?
- A musical lighter.

806
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,014
- That's great.
- Show him your watch.

807
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,812
Look.

808
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,155
And I've got a gadget that rings
when the parking meter is up.

809
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:45,888
Is that it?

810
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,962
A new Snorkel-brand pen
from America

811
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,656
with automatic refill
and retractable nib.

812
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,797
A fiber belt from Oceania.

813
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,639
A hat for the tropics.

814
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,277
My suit's from London,
made of Australian wool.

815
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,379
I have vented shoes
of Egyptian leather.

816
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,311
I've got so much stuff

817
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,349
I could puke.

818
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:14,450
My scarf looks like silk,
but it's really metal.

819
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:18,058
A really flexible metal.

820
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,853
It's Japanese. Feel it.

821
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:23,122
- It's not metal, it's cloth.
- It's Japanese metal!

822
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,130
No, it's not.
It's not even Japanese.

823
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,702
- I swear it's the truth.
- No reason to lie about it.

824
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,204
If I'm lying, may my mother
keel over this instant!

825
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,444
- Okay, I believe you.
- You should.

826
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,963
It's me - LÈna.

827
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,372
Come along,
and don't make noise.

828
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,705
Oh, my head!

829
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,570
Shit!

830
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,008
Wait. I'll have a look.

831
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,380
Damn it!
The cops are still here!

832
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,853
- What about Fido?
- I'll tell you later.

833
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,194
All clear.

834
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,925
I borrowed a car.

835
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,826
- From whom?
- My landlady.

836
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,332
- You must be on good terms.
- I know where she leaves the key.

837
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,335
Can you make it?
Hold on to me.

838
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,682
It's all true, Officer.
Just ask the neighbors.

839
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:55,119
You know how it goes.
One thing leads to another.

840
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,077
The cops?

841
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:22,115
They really grilled me.
They're at the neighbors' now.

842
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,719
You may need this.
- I'll call from the road.

843
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,720
- Fido.
- I'll explain later.

844
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,429
You got the bottle?

845
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:42,632
Here.

846
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,277
Have some.

847
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,704
I'm still thirsty.

848
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,978
I was a prize jerk not to see it.

849
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,590
They went from Chico
to me to Fido.

850
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:07,957
The abominable Saroyan brothers
are in the soup again.

851
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,364
She's conking out again.

852
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,939
For the third time!

853
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,610
What a crate!
We'd do better in a pushcart.

854
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,975
- What's wrong with it?
- How should I know?

855
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,844
- We'll have to push.
- Come on.

856
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:31,747
Can you see?
- Yeah.

857
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,386
Look where you're heading!
Hold it straight.

858
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,688
Come on, push!

859
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,926
Careful.
You're veering to the side.

860
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,261
Funny thing, an engine.

861
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:53,631
- What about that? Or that?
- Don't touch.

862
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:06,453
- Does the radio work?
- I don't know. Try it.

863
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:12,058
Off in the distance
far from the violins

864
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,299
Far from the shepherds too

865
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:22,067
Dressed in knightly garb

866
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:29,438
Forty of the king's jesters

867
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:33,975
Painted in brightest hue

868
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,612
And angels

869
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,256
Hovering over us

870
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:48,155
There on the horizon

871
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:56,728
When my love turns to hate
you'll be sure to know

872
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:03,208
When my love turns to hate
I'll wear a cap as I go

873
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:10,350
When you stop loving me
I'll make it very plain

874
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:17,721
When you stop loving me
my hair will hang free

875
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:22,657
My love now wears
her hair piled high

876
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,891
In every kind of weather

877
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:32,105
His head is bared for me

878
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,433
Stop.

879
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,235
- We' re not there yet.
- I said stop!

880
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,641
What are you doing?

881
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:45,378
We split up here.
T ake the car back to your landlady.

882
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,552
Look at me.

883
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,857
Parting would be easier
if she'd let you drink the whole bottle.

884
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,191
Turn left at the crossroads.

885
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,364
I know the way.

886
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,300
What are you waiting for?

887
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:03,529
She knows you want her to stay,
but it can't be.

888
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,570
Thanks for the ride.

889
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,733
- Hi, Richard.
- Well, well.

890
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,105
You here alone?
I heard a car.

891
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:44,075
- A friend brought me.
- I see.

892
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,373
Sorry, but we're all
on a short fuse up here.

893
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:50,348
Some guys are gunning for Chico.
He must have told you.

894
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,817
He's here?
When did he get here?

895
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,685
This afternoon, half dead
from hitching and running.

896
01:09:56,892 --> 01:10:00,760
He's better now, catching a snooze.
He ate enough grub for four.

897
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,863
Aren't Mom and Dad here?

898
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:06,762
- We moved 'em down to the village.
- Are you nuts?

899
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,802
You think I enjoyed it?
I like them too.

900
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,838
We've got nice old folks.
Never a pain in the ass.

901
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,408
But they're not bullet-proof!

902
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,640
No visitors?

903
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,618
So we got here first.

904
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,687
What a knucklehead, that Chico.

905
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,882
Don't stick up for him.
He always botches everything.

906
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,323
If jackasses could fly,
he'd be squadron commander.

907
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:38,398
- He was in a jam.
- He's always in a jam. You know why?

908
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,265
'Cause he always messes up!
- It's not his fault I killed a guy.

909
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,635
- What?
- That's right.

910
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,204
Yesterday evening.

911
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,940
We're in a nice fix.

912
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:56,140
Those two guys have snatched Fido.
Meanwhile, the cops are on your tail.

913
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,616
But hey, you know what?

914
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,346
I'm happy to see you again.

915
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:04,617
- Likewise.
- "Me too," as the Brits say.

916
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,556
Is that coffee I smell?

917
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,730
Damn it!
"Boiled coffee, spoiled coffee!"

918
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,992
I tell you, a guy goes stir-crazy
after a while

919
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,637
when he can't move freely.

920
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:20,940
You hate waking up in the morning,
feeling like a prisoner.

921
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,475
At first Chico and I
had some good laughs.

922
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,738
We thought it was funny.

923
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:30,246
I'll wake Chico up
and tell him you're here.

924
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:46,191
- You're here?
- Yeah. How's the shiner?

925
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,302
Okay.
Doesn't hurt anymore.

926
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,096
What's that?

927
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,003
The loot.
That's what I went to Paris for.

928
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,542
They're new bills,
all marked and numbered.

929
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:01,512
Gotta come up with a good scheme
to unload them.

930
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:06,086
Richard and me, we'd gone straight
and got a good, honest job.

931
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,415
At an exchange house.

932
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,684
One day these two guys
stick us up.

933
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,494
We laughed

934
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,597
and said we could teach 'em
a thing or two about stick-ups.

935
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:20,860
So they said,
"Then how about a four-way split?"

936
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,231
Richard and I
looked at each other.

937
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,432
It was too good to pass up,
so we took off with the two guys.

938
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,703
We thought we'd lay low up here.

939
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:36,376
Well, right off, right in the car,
they started griping.

940
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,647
"It's too far. "
"What's with all the snow?"

941
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:46,225
So we dumped them
and kept the bundle for ourselves.

942
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,728
Now they want our hides.

943
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:52,958
We should have
bumped them off first.

944
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,296
Like Charlie here.
He killed some guy.

945
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,366
No shit!

946
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,834
It can't be.

947
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,775
I gotta say,
I'm glad to hear it.

948
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,716
Now you're just like us.

949
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,719
Remember the slingshots?

950
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,289
What slingshots?

951
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,894
And those characters
in the limousine who came for you?

952
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,564
The young prodigy.
The 14-year old virtuoso.

953
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,098
To take you to the old man
at the music school?

954
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,194
Yeah, Zeleny.

955
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,099
And as we drove
through the woods,

956
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,035
you two bombarded
the car with rocks.

957
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,676
The guys in the car
didn't know who you were.

958
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:40,941
But the dame with the blue hair
and dark glasses asked who you were.

959
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,846
I said, "Who? Those boys?"

960
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:46,111
She said, "Those aren't boys,
they're wild beasts.

961
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,555
And what did you say?

962
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:52,924
"Those are my brothers, ma'am. "
She quickly changed the subject.

963
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:58,122
She talked about the academy
and my great teacher and all that jazz.

964
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,999
Rocks kept bouncing off the car
the whole time,

965
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,764
as if you and Richard
were talking to me,

966
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:09,069
telling me I was bound
to come back someday for good.

967
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,569
Back to the wild beasts.

968
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,044
You had to come back, Charlie,
'cause we're all alike -

969
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,809
you, me, Richard, even Fido.

970
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,385
Listen, let's hit the sack.

971
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:22,148
Chico, you're on watch.

972
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,484
Go on to bed. I'm not sleepy.
I want a smoke.

973
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,786
Then I'll leave this with you.

974
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,889
Man's best friend.

975
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:42,026
So now you're a killer
in a family of thieves. No problem!

976
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,535
Only there is a problem:
all this craziness.

977
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,335
Where did you and your brothers
get it from?

978
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:52,578
Not Mom, not Dad. Must have
skipped a generation or two.

979
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,113
It can resurface
after hundreds of years.

980
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:58,753
Some Saroyans long ago probably
did some crazy things

981
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,115
and then hid out,
like us now.

982
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,724
It'd make a good poem.
A comic one, of course.

983
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,324
And this useless gun?

984
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,895
"I'll leave this for you.
Man's best friend. "

985
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:14,467
He says that to me,
who hates guns!

986
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,648
- Where's Fido?
- No sign of him.

987
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,952
We had it figured wrong.
- We're leaving. I'm taking you back.

988
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:42,460
- And the cops?
- You can stop worrying.

989
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:45,792
You're cleared. Self-defense.
The neighbors backed your story.

990
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,164
You threw the knife down,
but Plyne tried to strangle you.

991
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:52,169
You only meant to jab his arm.
It was an accident.

992
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,638
I'd never have thought.
Where's the car?

993
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,834
Over there. Come on.

994
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,206
I have to tell them first.
Wait for me.

995
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,905
You'll come back?
You swear?

996
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,648
You know...

997
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:09,182
"When my love turns to hate,
I'll wear a cap as I go. "

998
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,812
Goddamn it!

999
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,225
Hell, it's snowing!

1000
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,132
Not like that, honey.
You'll break the glasses.

1001
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,234
Like this.
And set them down gently.

1002
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,337
Charlie, meet the new waitress.

1003
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,564
Charlie, the piano player.

1
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:13,422
Do you have Criminal Women
by Stanislas Previn?

2
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,690
Is it a novel?

3
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,335
No, it's a sociology thesis

4
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,471
I'll have to ask the boss

5
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,869
Do we have Criminal Women?

6
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,572
Yes, it was a sociology thesis...

7
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,545
it was never published

8
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,049
But it was listed last year

9
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,983
I remember very well

10
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,452
Criminal Women by Stanislas Previn

11
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,285
it should have been published
a year ago

12
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:47,194
I really don't know what happened

13
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,595
THE YEAR BEFORE

14
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:11,188
This is Professor Previn,
a sociologist

15
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,890
Studying criminal women

16
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:13,820
I know

17
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,429
He will begin with...
what's her name?

18
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,724
Camilla Bliss

19
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,431
She's just a little tramp

20
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,103
We have more interesting cases

21
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,100
The one who drove 600 miles
to knock off...

22
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,870
I know, the old Pole

23
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,602
And the one who cut men up

24
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,542
The buzz-saw Killer!

25
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,547
The giant who strangled her man
with one hand!

26
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:44,280
Yes, but I prefer to start with Mrs. Bliss

27
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,448
As you like

28
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,490
Here's your permit

29
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:55,532
to be stamped at each visit

30
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,223
This way, Sir

31
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,632
There's a table for you
Is it alright?

32
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,133
Certainly
Thank you

33
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,895
You want to see Bliss now?

34
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,903
Yes, please, if I may

35
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,359
Mrs. Bliss?

36
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,294
I'm Stanislas Previn

37
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,198
I assume they told you about me

38
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,997
You're the writer!

39
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,867
Well, no, not exactly

40
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,942
I'm writing a sociology thesis

41
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,771
What's that?

42
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:20,178
Sociology is the study of
social phenomena

43
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,847
I'm interested in you, what you did
and why

44
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,922
No shit! A novel about me?

45
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,222
Not exactly, it's more like a study

46
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,901
Let's have a voice test

47
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,137
The girl with the banjo

48
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,335
All naked in her rancho

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,665
She can never say no

50
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,772
The girl with the banjo!

51
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,720
Pretty good, huh?

52
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,457
Say, do books make big money?

53
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,786
I don't know, it's my first

54
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:07,022
Let's start from the beginning

55
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,528
My first question concerns your father's
death

56
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,968
Okay, I was nine, see?

57
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,231
I lived on a farm with my folks

58
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,841
Fucking bitch! Like your Ma!

59
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,272
Lousy tramp!

60
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,881
All whores except for my Ma... maybe

61
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,783
So, the ladder...

62
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,325
I took it to wash the windows

63
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,998
How could I know Pa was up there?

64
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,392
They said I lied

65
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,362
So, like the papers wrote

66
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,798
that's how come I wasted my youth
in jail

67
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,200
So, this tragedy and
lack of understanding...

68
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,639
explain your adult life

69
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,348
and why you were accused of
another murder

70
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,949
Hey, got a butt?

71
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:06,914
No, thank you

72
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:07,847
What a jerk!

73
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm not offering

74
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,547
I'm asking for a butt

75
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,884
A cigarette! Get it?

76
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,591
Oh, I see, excuse me
I don't smoke

77
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,563
So the connection between Pa's
accident and...

78
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,894
What they say I did this time

79
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:29,565
Like my lawyer says, if I'd had
a happy childhood

80
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,276
I won't be here today

81
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,910
He said it right out

82
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,976
That's what my lawyer says

83
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,583
Mrs. Bliss, did you really kill your father?

84
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,252
Tell me the truth

85
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,783
It was like this, see?

86
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,183
A fate-bet

87
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,791
A fate-bet! You know...

88
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,360
Whenever Pa juiced up
he'd kick my ass

89
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,361
I'd had it, know what I mean?

90
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,731
So, by taking away the ladder
I'm betting

91
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,169
If the old man sees his lift's gone

92
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:06,742
He'll yell and then
beat the shit out of me

93
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,915
But if he doesn't notice, Bang!
I win

94
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,014
And I won!

95
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,810
Ain't that something?

96
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,883
That's fatality!

97
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,955
But let's not talk about all that

98
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,420
I don't want to get you depressed

99
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,396
Mind if I step out for a minute?

100
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,798
Here, hold my cigarette

101
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,633
Matron

102
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,336
I gotta go!

103
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:49,884
The expression "fate-bet" is
very significant

104
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,680
And I will try to determine
its precise meaning

105
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,952
It is probably a rationalization

106
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,293
Mrs. Bliss uses to reject
her responsibility and her guilt feelings

107
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,315
After your father's death

108
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,282
You went to an orphanage

109
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,613
And because of a few youthful pranks

110
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,260
You wound up in an institution

111
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,461
They called it...

112
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,194
Observation Centre for
Juvenile Delinquents

113
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,832
Not for long

114
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,767
Because I got time off
for good behavior

115
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,607
You want mine? It's bigger!

116
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,981
Here, I brought you some eats

117
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,812
No dessert?

118
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:16,756
I'm your dessert!

119
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,869
Oh shit!

120
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,630
I'm coming, Ma

121
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,974
I'll be back

122
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,056
Who's honking?

123
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,892
Nobody, Ma

124
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,099
I ain't nuts! Hear that?

125
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,536
Don't hear nothing

126
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,017
Gonna dump this stinking wine

127
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,581
You sneaking out again?

128
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,951
No, Ma, I swear

129
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,256
So he dishonored me, that shit

130
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,758
Were you still a virgin
when you met him?

131
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,297
Half and half

132
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,160
At the Center

133
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,233
We couldn't go out

134
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,406
But the milkman, baker, doctor got in

135
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,075
My first was the doctor

136
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,677
Wow! Could he examine you!

137
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,072
Know how long I hid out?

138
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,350
Three weeks!

139
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,515
Clovis was scared of his Ma

140
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,844
But I had my plan

141
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,080
And one night I barged in on them

142
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,770
What's that?

143
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:09,770
Clovis! Darling!

144
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,064
Who's that?

145
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,207
I don't know

146
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,206
You don't know? Look, lady

147
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:18,244
I've been in his car for weeks

148
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,609
He bangs me all day

149
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,011
And he doesn't know!

150
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,119
Move over

151
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,849
I'm not of age, lady

152
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,751
I'm not having no baby in a rumble seat!

153
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,150
I'm pregnant

154
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,951
You're a granny!

155
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,859
You little shithead!

156
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,267
Oh Christ!

157
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:45,101
If your Pa could see you

158
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,010
A horny, dirty slob!

159
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,653
You win, I'll handle this!

160
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,990
So we got hitched

161
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,950
Old Isabel was so scared

162
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,955
She fixed everything

163
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,156
Went and got the license and all

164
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,262
And the little one?

165
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,593
Me? A baby? Are you kidding?

166
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,135
After the wedding,
I said, sorry, no baby

167
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,838
They didn't shed no tears

168
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,009
Did you get on with your mother-in-law?

169
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,939
She hated my guts but like I told her

170
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,407
You didn't lose a son

171
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,080
You found a daughter

172
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,815
You didn't lose a son

173
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,087
You found a daughter

174
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,754
Take this down, Helen

175
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,920
Clearly Camilla sought with Mr. Bliss

176
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,226
A compensation
for the hostile environment

177
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:52,036
of her childhood

178
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,006
You feel that you'd been unlucky
since childhood?

179
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,480
You bet! With that lousy meathead

180
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,448
It was always the same old crap

181
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,256
What vulgarity!

182
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,823
You'll change that?

183
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,552
No, we must respect her personality

184
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,194
File the tapes carefully

185
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,866
We may have to hear them again

186
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,312
Can we have dinner?

187
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,480
Thank you, Helen, but I have work to do

188
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,920
My aunt was happy to know
I'm working for you

189
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,455
That's nice
Good-bye

190
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,063
You're the one who visits Camilla?

191
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,034
They finally got her behind bars

192
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,808
But wait and see

193
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,207
She'll swipe them before she skips

194
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,176
You know Mrs. Bliss?

195
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,714
You bet! She's from my hometown

196
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,715
She's a handful, that one!

197
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,000
Guess who?

198
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,633
How's tricks?

199
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:25,961
Sorry, I didn't hear you

200
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,767
Madame

201
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,507
What is it?

202
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,867
I don't see no Madame here

203
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,610
For you

204
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,110
Camels! No shit! I'll take two

205
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,274
Take them all

206
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,111
That your book?
Real neat

207
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,751
Did you type it yourself?

208
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,547
No, a girl friend helps me

209
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,792
Tell me about her!

210
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:48,516
What's her name? I bet she's stacked

211
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,892
You know what, be a doll

212
00:18:54,466 --> 00:19:00,234
Get me back my banjo!

213
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,735
My banjo!

214
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,913
Oh, I see... I thought it was
a slang expression

215
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,910
My uncle taught me
when I was kid

216
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,650
and I worked on it with Sam Golden

217
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,580
So if I had my banjo

218
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,550
I'd sing my story

219
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,155
Like a musical

220
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,686
Well I'm not sure...
but...

221
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:30,491
I'll ask for it

222
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,267
You need anything else?

223
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,032
Yeah! Some goodies!

224
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,210
Know what I go for?

225
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,447
Almonds and peanuts and such

226
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,739
We never get none here

227
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:45,642
Ready?

228
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,475
We're all set

229
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,247
Right
You had just got married

230
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,657
Did you work at the garage?

231
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,957
Old Isabel wouldn't let me...

232
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,288
Go near customers

233
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,556
Bookkeeping

234
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,062
Oh no!

235
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:08,334
I was exploring, sort of

236
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,317
Fill her up

237
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,027
How much d'you have left?

238
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,426
About a gallon

239
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,828
You still got gas, get going!

240
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,469
God damn pain in the ass

241
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,287
Folks said Isabel was loaded

242
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,818
Clovis had only his expectations

243
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,354
Yet, anything can happen

244
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,494
She was always...

245
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,228
Poking around the oven in the cellar

246
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,500
I figured the dough was there
but digging it up

247
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:14,570
With her alive, no dice!

248
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,622
My dishes sparkle

249
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,763
My hands are white

250
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,695
My toilet's clean

251
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:48,701
I'm happy with Kleenex

252
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,201
Not too tired, missy?

253
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,067
I'll live

254
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,976
Thank God for the commercials

255
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:56,940
That Kleenex dame

256
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,250
She had it made

257
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,420
So why not me?

258
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,385
Hey! Wait!

259
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,059
Off to bed, baby

260
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,142
Why the wine?

261
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,581
He had only 2 ideas

262
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,756
Not 3, just 2

263
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,857
You know what...
booze!

264
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,355
I'd had it, mister!

265
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,327
One night, I got him up at 4 a.m.

266
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,470
Open it up!

267
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,288
It wasn't the next egg
just a dividend

268
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,773
Your dirty crooks!

269
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,050
Why did you do it?

270
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,982
I took our wedding present

271
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:44,813
You can't!

272
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,317
Well, I did!

273
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,389
Where?

274
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,286
To Paris!

275
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,488
And on the road

276
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,663
His heap broke down

277
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,492
I don't get it

278
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,236
You're supposed to know about cars

279
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,133
I'll call Ma

280
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,637
What's wrong with it?

281
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,733
I don't know
I'll call Ma

282
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,842
It's her or me!

283
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,035
It's Ma

284
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,272
So long

285
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:17,312
Baby! Don't go!

286
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,090
The jerk came back!

287
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,790
I just couldn't shake him

288
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,660
Over his shoulder I saw a big sign

289
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,800
I must turn the reel over

290
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:53,081
Criminal Women 2nd interview

291
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,954
All set? Where were we?

292
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,355
The Colt Saloon

293
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:04,058
Say, Stan, you know something?
Your tie's corny

294
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,531
His tie now
What next

295
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,056
All for me?

296
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,230
And nuts too!

297
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,728
If I wasn't so shy I'd kiss you

298
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,197
Want a peanut?

299
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,068
Shall we proceed?

300
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,238
Where were we?

301
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,531
The Colt Saloon

302
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,274
A classy joint
I was hostess

303
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,605
Sam Golden was the star

304
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,178
A great artist!

305
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,535
Sam Golden, he sensed I was musical

306
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,774
Clovis and me, we lived in a fleabag

307
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,275
I watched TV all day to get away

308
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,175
From that sex maniac

309
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,164
Cut it out, will you? Lay off!

310
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,278
I wanna do it!

311
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,543
Drop dead!

312
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:16,416
I'm the boss
Stop the TV

313
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,428
Watch it angel, you're cracking up

314
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,690
Turn that off!

315
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,730
Try saying it in Spanish

316
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,704
My TV.! You crummy motherfucker!

317
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,572
I hate your guts!

318
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,808
You shithead! I'm splitting!

319
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,451
So I kept mum, very dignified

320
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,087
Like he'd not bust up my TV

321
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:50,946
Just walked out

322
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,221
Like the Queen of England

323
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,487
Real class!

324
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,259
Shit!

325
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,623
You never considered a loyal talk
with Mr. Bliss?

326
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,890
I figured he could screw himself

327
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,861
He had a disgusting habit

328
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,367
He was always scratching his crotch

329
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,936
I couldn't stand it

330
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,435
So you thought of divorce

331
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,512
I thought of running to Sam Golden

332
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,514
The first guy I met with his name
in big lights

333
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,583
I figured if he made it

334
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,516
Why couldn't I?

335
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,782
You saw Mr. Golden as...

336
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,494
A superior being?

337
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,059
You bet!

338
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,924
I always respect people with big names

339
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:41,662
They know all about life, see?

340
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,247
Sam! I'm real glad you're here

341
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,180
Look, I'm in a big mess

342
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,254
Clovis got himself a gun, he's nuts!

343
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,822
I'm an ex-virgin and I'm scared!

344
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,120
Shut the door!

345
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,707
Take that off
Everything!

346
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,184
Sweet

347
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,558
Sweet little birdie

348
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,131
Poor little birdie

349
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:23,338
Warm and soft in the hand

350
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,370
You like?

351
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,438
Terrific!

352
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,837
Who inspired it?

353
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,502
You did

354
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,475
He made it up right off the bat

355
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,616
Anyhow, both of us being musical

356
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,184
We became intimate like

357
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,987
Your husband had no suspicious?

358
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,786
We were damned careful, you bet!

359
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,986
But that lose, Alfonso the dummy

360
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,799
He ratted on us

361
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,661
A broad? So what?

362
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,671
My broad? Camilla?

363
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,911
With that two-bit clown?

364
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,172
Making it together?

365
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,450
Shut up, damn you!

366
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,926
I know you're in there!

367
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,066
Son of a bitch! It's Clovis!

368
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,435
Make way for the widow

369
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,312
Clovis angel! They killed him!

370
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,640
My husband! He's dead!

371
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,715
He was so kind, so sweet

372
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,082
I've got nothing to live for

373
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,916
Clovis, my love, wait for me!

374
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,256
Only he wasn't dead, that louse!

375
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,555
You know what?

376
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,356
You'd be cute with long hair

377
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,968
I don't know...
The hour is over

378
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,605
Hey! Don't forget my banjo!

379
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,898
And peanuts!

380
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,941
Never mind the rest

381
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,739
3rd interview

382
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,412
Will you take a few notes?

383
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,676
Comments on the interview

384
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,787
The subject often requests gifts

385
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,354
This indicates a need for appreciation

386
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:57,458
As if possessions compensated

387
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,026
Lack of love

388
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,289
Moreover

389
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,593
We have a possible equation

390
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,702
Between sex and music

391
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:13,970
Mrs. Bliss treasures her banjo

392
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,408
And if we consider
its suggestive contours

393
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,549
We have a sublimated penis envy

394
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,082
Lack of love! Sublimated penis

395
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,117
Isn't it all far-fetched?

396
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:29,625
Has it never occurred to you
that's she's just a tramp?

397
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,557
That is a very unscientific remark

398
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,273
The banjo is okay

399
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,342
But it doesn't mean Bliss will be

400
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,811
Exempted form work

401
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,414
My banjo!

402
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,348
It's off-key but never mind

403
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,822
Oh! Stanislas, that's real classy!

404
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,361
I've got a present too

405
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,365
For me?

406
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,060
No, for the Pope!

407
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,034
And knitted by Camomille

408
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,766
That's what Sam called me for fun

409
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,545
They're very nice

410
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,447
Hide them!

411
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,315
Through a musical career

412
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:38,392
You hoped to find the social approval

413
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,621
You craved for as a child

414
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,298
On the nose!

415
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,195
Okay where were we?

416
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,868
Ah, Clovis was in hospital, and me

417
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,403
Big hearted me, I brought him goodies

418
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,245
You didn't divorce?

419
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,083
Divorce a slob with 27 fractures?

420
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,552
I got too much class!

421
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,495
Anyway, while he was laid up

422
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,131
I took care of my career

423
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:19,230
You started with Golden on a purely
professional basis

424
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,664
And love came later, right?

425
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,066
Trouble was...

426
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,707
Sam was so wild over me

427
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,571
I just couldn't keep his mind

428
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,348
On my career

429
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:34,951
The girl with the banjo

430
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,778
All naked in her rancho

431
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,216
She can never say no

432
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,981
Get off the air!

433
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,655
There's a law says only you can sing?

434
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,430
Guess what?

435
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,261
Forget it!

436
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,732
Tonight we go dancing

437
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:59,170
Dancing my ass! We ball right here!

438
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,184
I sure turn you on, don't I?

439
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,683
If not you, it's the guitar

440
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,753
Get your ass over here!

441
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,807
When are we going to rehearse?

442
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,480
You want a hit on the mouth? Out!

443
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,077
Who d'ya think you are?

444
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,185
Scram!

445
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,486
Someone knocked

446
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,386
Open up
I'm working

447
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,059
If it's a broad for you

448
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,421
She'll get it in the ass!

449
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,299
Is Sam Golden in?

450
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,560
My husband is busy

451
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,671
Who's this tramp, Roger?

452
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,276
I don't know

453
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,138
I'm Mrs. Sam Golden!

454
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,042
Roger, come on out!

455
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,181
Had a nice trip, honey?

456
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,353
This belongs to Roger?

457
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,587
It's mine!

458
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:18,818
And this?

459
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,115
Mine, lady

460
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,621
And this?
And that?

461
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,656
You need any help, lady?

462
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,955
And that?

463
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,499
My purse!

464
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,337
You slut!

465
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,664
Slut yourself!

466
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,814
Get out!

467
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:51,249
Beat it! Out!

468
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,799
Shit, it's torn

469
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,338
Oh please

470
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:50,671
Step on it

471
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:51,779
It's a matter of life and death!

472
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,414
I'll explain later

473
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:05,425
ARTHUR EXTERMINATOR

474
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:11,356
I told him how I was a victim

475
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,468
Drunken parents, a sick brother

476
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,228
That I wanted to die

477
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,442
And he kept on saying
Poor little bird

478
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,934
Do you love God?

479
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,611
You bet!

480
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,472
Do you work?

481
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,548
I'm a singer

482
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,776
Sure, on radio and all

483
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,217
Poor, poor little bird

484
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,219
You must be rich

485
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,154
No, show business is so...

486
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,688
How do you say?

487
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,019
Tentacular?

488
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,220
You said it!

489
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,159
After paying my agent

490
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,264
My musicians, taxes and all

491
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:48,095
I gotta hitch a ride home

492
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,634
Where to?

493
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,776
My brother's, but he's in the hospital

494
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,008
Is it enough?

495
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,239
I didn't ask!

496
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,975
True, but doctor's fees

497
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,284
For your sick brother

498
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,888
Take it

499
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:14,328
Well, okay
What must I do?

500
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,400
Smile at life, and dine with me

501
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,570
Is that all?

502
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,138
I'm a gentleman

503
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,435
I'll give you more

504
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,473
I want to

505
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,337
Well

506
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,478
At dinner tonight

507
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,015
I'll tell you all the secrets
of my vocation

508
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,220
Why an exterminator?

509
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:43,850
Love of animals or love of men?

510
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:44,619
You love animals

511
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,896
Or you love men

512
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,060
Save some for dinner

513
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,160
Because I'm cold and anyways

514
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:53,163
Here we are!

515
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,102
Poor child!

516
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,466
You're freezing
I'm a cad!

517
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,834
Be right back

518
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,820
My name is Murene, attorney

519
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,463
Sorry to barge in, my secretary is ill

520
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:24,792
Could I see your husband?

521
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:25,933
After his accident

522
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:30,832
Did he get any compensation?

523
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:31,973
Not a cent!

524
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,937
They just carted him off

525
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,773
I thought so!

526
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,675
They run you down and skip off!

527
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,816
I'll handle it

528
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,643
But I must see Mr. Bliss first

529
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,378
He's got a lot of money coming

530
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:46,382
He's in the hospital

531
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,215
I'll take it

532
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,259
I don't have the money in my hat,
little lady

533
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,261
We must sue, convince a jury

534
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:03,200
Can't we talk it over?

535
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,533
Sure, come right in

536
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,745
I'll tell my cousin not to wait

537
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,242
I can't have dinner with you

538
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,249
There's this lawyer for my brother

539
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,490
When you're a victim

540
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,158
He fights for justice

541
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,326
Certainly

542
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,422
That's Right

543
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,656
Sorry for the mess

544
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:35,362
Had to rush out to work

545
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,733
Please don't bother

546
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,033
This place is charming

547
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,105
It's sort of small

548
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,938
But nice and cozy

549
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,079
It's hot in here!

550
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,684
Not at all

551
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,219
Want a drink?

552
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,947
Whiskey, if I may

553
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,785
We've only got wine

554
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,618
My husband don't drink

555
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,124
Here's to his health!

556
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,026
And to his home-coming!

557
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:08,534
That's right
He's in the hospital

558
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,969
You must feel terribly lonely

559
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,402
In the daytime it's okay

560
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,772
But at night!

561
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,139
I understand

562
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:24,285
Solitude! How well I know it!

563
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,955
I must tell you

564
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,920
I've never met anyone

565
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,387
A woman, I mean

566
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:37,662
With whom I can really relax

567
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,162
He relaxed so good

568
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,633
I wondered if he'd even make it home

569
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:46,170
I wondered if he'd even make it home

570
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,604
A nympho!

571
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,575
I bet she even raped the exterminator

572
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,111
Not at all

573
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,348
Let's go on

574
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,146
The subject's numerous affairs

575
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,847
Reveal an emotional insecurity

576
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,962
Caused by an unhappy childhood

577
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,357
I know emotionally insecure alley cats

578
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:13,228
But she beats them all!

579
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,198
It's none of my business

580
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,337
But you worry me

581
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:19,802
Good God! Why?

582
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,478
You don't see the real Camilla

583
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,375
She claims she sings

584
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,445
And write songs

585
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,583
But does she study music? No!

586
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,844
She just hops into bed with the band!

587
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,453
You exaggerate

588
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,922
We shouldn't judge her

589
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:41,086
But try to understand
Proceed

590
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,764
This country girl

591
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,696
Pitched into the bizarre world
of show business

592
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,234
Was doomed to be the victim of it

593
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,202
You really believe that?

594
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,069
She's not a victim

595
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,905
She's a menace!

596
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,584
And those gloves!

597
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,210
A present from my aunt

598
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,012
Your aunt's a whore!

599
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,494
Bliss is punished

600
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:13,854
Why?

601
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:17,693
She stole gloves another inmate
had knitted

602
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,629
For her husband, a goal keeper

603
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,499
Visiting rights are suspended

604
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,743
Until further notice

605
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,774
I'll call

606
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,244
Going already?

607
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,785
Cammie won't talk in your funny box
anymore?

608
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,287
She's punished

609
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,119
That's no news

610
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,589
It all began with the death of her Pa

611
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:50,197
What's your opinion of that tragedy?

612
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,767
She took the ladder

613
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,438
And the force of gravity did the rest

614
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,767
No question about it!

615
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:00,637
Everybody knows that

616
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:01,603
She took it

617
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,037
To wash the windows

618
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,115
Camilla wash windows?

619
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:10,846
Hell man! She's got other things
on her mind!

620
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,183
Wherever she went

621
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:18,656
That kid sure left her mark!

622
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,796
Especially on the boys!

623
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,627
Women blew hot and cold

624
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,166
But the guys, wow!

625
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,766
They were fond of her?

626
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,972
Like you're fond of public utilities

627
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,537
You can't do without, right?

628
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,470
Mrs. Bliss is not a utility!

629
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,201
Let me tell you about the time

630
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:43,543
She locked herself in the chapel with
the gardener

631
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,817
Excuse me
I'm in a hurry

632
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,436
I'm Stanislas

633
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,546
The professor, sure

634
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,682
You called me

635
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,717
Does it work okay?

636
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,052
Well?

637
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,282
Mrs. Bliss told me about you

638
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,859
Shitting all over my public image again

639
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:29,032
Not at all
She admires you very much

640
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,425
I should hope so!

641
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,599
I laid her, so what?

642
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,897
Damn! What did she say about me?

643
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,772
She said you are a very great artist

644
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,214
She's a good kid

645
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,077
I miss her

646
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,912
She could've sung too
For laughs!

647
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:52,246
Would you say

648
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:55,525
Camilla is an artist, a pro?

649
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,126
In the hay, she's sure a pro

650
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,362
But her voice stinks

651
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,464
How is she?
Still well stacked?

652
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,361
She is a fine looking person

653
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,469
If she's freed she will need

654
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,731
A loving contact with reality

655
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,636
I'm ready to lay her any time!

656
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,039
That's contact!

657
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:21,014
That's not what I mean

658
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,617
Camilla needs to relate

659
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,480
To real people in real situations

660
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,719
Do you understand me?

661
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,427
Take your time, Professor

662
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:35,963
Don't lose your cool
Relax!

663
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:40,500
When she gets out, I'll fix her up

664
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,565
How's that? Fair enough

665
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,669
You go for her yourself

666
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:48,808
And you figure I'll cut you out

667
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,307
Not at all!

668
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,947
My interest in her

669
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,945
Is purely intellectual

670
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,982
Man, I dig your style

671
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,051
But with camilla you gotta

672
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,085
Hit the target

673
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,254
The only thing on your mind

674
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,790
Is to exploit Camilla!

675
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,123
Calling me a pimp?

676
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:14,194
I dig your problem but what can I do?

677
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:19,565
It's been an exercise talking to you

678
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,674
I hate to break it up

679
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,635
Hey! Look!

680
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,807
That your angel cake?

681
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,555
Did you find your husband changed?

682
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,061
Same creep!

683
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,392
His 27 fractures
Hadn't changed him any

684
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,626
The lawyer said to visit Clovis every day

685
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,906
It was damned far

686
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:56,636
I had Arthur the ant-killer and his truck
He was my cabbie

687
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,141
Your brother?

688
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,975
He's recovering

689
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,277
He'll be home soon

690
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,949
but I wonder where

691
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:10,490
I'll get the dough for a wheel-chair
For his re-education

692
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:11,716
Take it!

693
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:12,620
I can't!

694
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,888
You must! Material things don't matter

695
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:22,834
What good is my money if I can't be
rewarded by your sweet smile?

696
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,106
Where to?

697
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:29,003
Colt Saloon
Gotta rehearse

698
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,836
Tell me, Mr. Arthur

699
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,946
So just to be polite

700
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,947
I asked about his work

701
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,915
That did it! He went on and on

702
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,249
Bugs, termites, mice

703
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:45,292
When I appear, they disappear

704
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,156
You'll ask me

705
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:47,418
What about spiders?

706
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:50,157
Why, don't you kill them?

707
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,831
Search me!

708
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,797
I'll be frank with you

709
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,768
The termite eats into...

710
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,233
The heart of the house

711
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:01,343
If it lives, the house dies

712
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,241
I foresee your next question

713
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,949
And can't help smiling

714
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,015
Why the centipede?

715
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,849
I say centipede like I'd say bed bug

716
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,389
Here we are!
Sorry

717
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:24,293
Mind waiting a minute?

718
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,162
My time is all yours

719
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,419
Have you studied paranormal science?

720
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,089
Paranormal what?

721
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,223
It's weird!

722
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:25,257
You hear cars pass long before
you see them

723
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,554
Or long after?

724
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,854
Look, Arthur

725
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,397
Gotta see my sick brother's lawyer

726
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,768
So this lady says

727
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,708
I've been toads in the nursery

728
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,415
I'm not crazy

729
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,279
I said, lady, where is the nursery?

730
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,680
Overlooking the pond, she says

731
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,322
Any water-lilies? I ask

732
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:56,549
yes, sir

733
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,591
Then that's it
I said

734
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,531
Just some dumb papers to sign

735
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,442
Don't worry

736
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,554
Everything will work out

737
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,954
Come in, little lady

738
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,928
My regards to your husband

739
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:45,905
Move!

740
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,169
You're terrible!

741
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:49,571
Let's skip the preliminaries

742
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:50,939
I'm a very busy man

743
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,650
Let's make wild love!

744
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,509
But hurry it up!

745
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:06,059
Be a good kid, sign here

746
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,131
And there

747
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,358
There's nothing written!

748
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,863
Just routine, little lady

749
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:18,267
I won't bother you with legal jargon

750
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,068
Careful, it's not dry

751
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,816
Aren't you ashamed?

752
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:32,049
Displaying all that trash to children

753
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,518
You have the money?

754
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,248
What money?

755
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,356
You should give me money

756
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,622
Look baby! I gotta make a living

757
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,765
Your husband got nun over

758
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,395
And he wants bread

759
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,230
You call, I come

760
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:51,872
But I'm no Salvation Army

761
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,303
Didn't your parents tell you

762
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,771
Lawyers equals dough

763
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,273
How much?

764
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,615
Those breasts! Those thighs!

765
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,340
It's a scandal!

766
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,382
An aggression

767
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,450
Against the mental integrity
Of helpless kids

768
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:12,989
Innocent children!

769
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,721
I know, I'm wrong

770
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,028
I shouldn't carry on so

771
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,862
What did the lawyer say

772
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,298
Is he efficient?

773
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,200
You bet! I'm pooped

774
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,308
All that running around killed me

775
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,874
I couldn't think straight

776
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,210
Keeping those four guys happy

777
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,214
At least one of them behaved properly

778
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,049
I mean Arthur

779
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,482
That one?

780
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,249
He was just like the rest

781
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,585
Except he didn't know it

782
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,795
Some little boys have no ambition

783
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,728
But at nine I decided I'd be
an exterminator

784
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,436
And I succeeded!

785
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,170
Look Miss Camilla

786
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,067
This attic is rotting

787
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,140
And without me

788
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,638
The house would collapse

789
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,717
It's like a cancer of the brain

790
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:11,478
The cruelty of it all!

791
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,353
See these two little flies in a spider web

792
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:22,624
They will be avenged

793
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,457
Come!

794
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,265
So I went over

795
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:26,901
But there was this rug

796
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,364
And I tripped

797
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,335
Arthur raved and ranted

798
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,108
Like I'd been killed

799
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,800
It's my fault

800
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,239
can you even forgive me?

801
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,415
Let me help, little bird

802
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:45,210
He grabbed me like an octopus

803
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:50,892
His hands were all over me

804
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,550
Fate was doing her bit

805
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,392
So I reckoned I must do mine

806
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,789
There was this old sofa

807
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,430
I grabbed Arthur

808
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:58,961
So his face was right over mine

809
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:09,578
Oh Arthur! I just couldn't help myself

810
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:17,586
Before we reached the sofa
We stopped being Platonic

811
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:21,516
I was his first!

812
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,385
He sure made up for lost time

813
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,187
The houses he dragged me to!

814
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,727
And each time...

815
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,327
The same routine

816
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,899
To turn him on

817
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,963
It had to be accidental

818
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,464
Trip on a step or a rug...
and then...

819
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:39,435
He would come on me

820
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,233
Forgive me!

821
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,971
What have I done?

822
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,641
How could I?

823
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:53,346
I succumbed to temptation

824
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,855
Oh the flesh! The body!

825
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:03,955
The body disobeyed the brain

826
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,362
I behaved like a beast

827
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,628
I must atone for this!

828
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:11,171
Here... please!

829
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,466
Don't say no!

830
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,672
Thank you!

831
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,938
The shyster took my dough

832
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,775
But Arthur gave it back in spades!

833
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,452
I couldn't hurt his feelings

834
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:28,249
You must have loved one of these men?

835
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,221
Well, I loved them all, see?

836
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,290
They were all different

837
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,157
But, Camilla, d'you realize...

838
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,366
You were calculating!

839
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,692
What do you think?

840
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,426
I don't just lay for no reason!

841
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,765
You had no regrets?

842
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,066
I was just sorry,
one day have only 24 hours

843
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:50,142
With four guys on my back

844
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:51,140
Four?

845
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,872
Sure, because Clovis was home
in his wheel-chair

846
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,847
But as horny as ever!

847
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,319
Just when I was trying to be nice
to them all

848
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,581
The shit hit the fan

849
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:08,555
Why are you in the dark?

850
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,898
Time's up!

851
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,436
We were talking and we forgot the time

852
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,905
Next time, I'll know better

853
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,773
No more favors

854
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,981
Except to you

855
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,758
You're so sweet

856
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:25,470
Camilla Bliss, 6th interview

857
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,740
Hey, you kids!

858
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:39,115
Play with Clovis, push his chair around

859
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:40,514
Do we have to?

860
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,258
It's fun you'll see!

861
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,761
I knew it!

862
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,196
You listen to me!

863
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,302
Go to hell!

864
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,673
That crummy shyster of yours...

865
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,342
Works for me

866
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,604
You know what you signed?

867
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,812
For Clovis

868
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,743
Admitting adultery!

869
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,975
It's worth big alimony

870
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:44,948
Up yours, lady!

871
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:47,979
Shove off, you! Get lost!

872
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,594
I was so mad

873
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,756
I ran to the only human person I knew

874
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,637
Go away!

875
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:18,286
Camilla! Wait!

876
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,715
Camilla, I hate to see you so unhappy

877
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,588
But glad that you're here

878
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:29,026
Who dared make you cry?

879
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:34,864
Why didn't you ask for my help?

880
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,968
I couldn't

881
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:38,830
Why not?

882
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,201
My brother!

883
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:42,969
Since he came home,
he's sort of weird

884
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:46,215
Like crazy jealous

885
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:50,115
Jealous! Your own brother?

886
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,182
Would he have incestuous ideas?

887
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,186
Well... he acts funny

888
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,322
Incest!

889
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,957
And that fink lawyer

890
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,455
Double-crossed us

891
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,859
What did he do? He neglected you?

892
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,089
Worse!

893
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:08,704
Don't tell me he dared lay hands on you

894
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,201
Oh Mr. Arthur, it's awful!

895
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,441
That's just what he did

896
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,768
The rat!

897
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:24,349
He's worse than the vermin
I exterminate!

898
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,383
Right! Are you my friend?

899
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:28,189
More than that

900
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,049
Well then...

901
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,792
Exterminate that rat!

902
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:37,364
Oh no!
I can't believe...

903
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:41,228
an angel like you
would ask me to kill a man

904
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,601
A human life is a light lit by God

905
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,710
Only he can snuff it out

906
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,208
Let me do this

907
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,105
Keep it!

908
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,210
With this you can afford

909
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:57,909
a reputable lawyer to protect you

910
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,747
You're disappointed!

911
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,154
Oh yes, I can tell you are!

912
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,188
Look

913
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,327
I'll finish my preparations

914
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,659
And take you home

915
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:14,164
My brother needs me

916
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:15,665
Just a minute

917
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,269
Can't wait

918
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,698
Are you angry?

919
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,499
I'm splitting!

920
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,837
I made another fate-bet

921
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,312
One that couldn't miss!

922
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,918
It's Camilla

923
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:51,031
I must see you, honey

924
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,758
I'm in a little hideaway

925
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,628
Chirac Castle, you know it?

926
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:57,933
And I've got your cash

927
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:01,109
Where is it, doll?

928
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,402
Right here, in my bra

929
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,637
Here I come

930
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,536
Clovis! You're walking!

931
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,642
You bet I am!

932
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,437
Where's your lover?

933
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:38,908
I'm by myself

934
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,878
By yourself, huh?

935
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,709
Hey you... exterminator!

936
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:46,149
I told you I'm alone!

937
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,255
I'm here on account of you

938
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,618
To meet a great bone-setter
I heard about

939
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,255
And who's that clown?

940
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,332
What you doing here with my wife?

941
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,298
She's my client

942
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:06,733
What do you want?

943
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,052
I'm an attorney

944
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:44,296
The two of them were laid out
real nice and cozy

945
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,998
I heard the voice of fate

946
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,368
Whispering to me,
On your way sister!

947
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,307
Get the lead out and move!

948
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,651
You knew what you'd done?

949
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,945
A fate-bet, but two to one!

950
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:02,783
After that, I was all shook up
I dragged my ass all night long

951
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:06,018
The next morning I'm pooped

952
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,057
So I head for home

953
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:12,257
That's when I got this awful shock!

954
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,034
Shock!

955
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,943
Arthur, let me explain

956
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,706
No more explaining

957
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,579
Two men almost died

958
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:19,893
What happened?

959
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,694
I don't' know, it's a shock to me

960
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,236
Give your pal the kiss of life

961
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,272
Quickly!

962
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,311
Okay, Clovis?

963
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,743
Clovis!

964
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,145
Sure

965
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,616
Her brother! Here, let me

966
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,117
Mr. Bliss

967
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,253
I don't know how you got here

968
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,485
But I wish to marry your sister

969
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,423
What sister?

970
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,062
You're a criminal

971
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,328
But I'm implicated in your crime

972
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,405
Your brother's your husband

973
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,269
And the lawyer is your lover

974
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:02,774
This accident is a crime!

975
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:05,139
And God sees it all

976
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,706
Get off the air!

977
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,049
You are cynical

978
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,277
But I'll play your game!

979
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,616
You revel in sin

980
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:17,724
So let us commit the worst sin of all

981
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,629
You dragged me into sin

982
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,429
Suicide is a mortal sin!

983
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:03,933
Jump first

984
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,504
Unless you want to join me after?

985
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,699
No! Together... eyes closed

986
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,237
Let's close our eyes

987
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,795
Luckily he jumped first

988
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,199
I shouldn't have run

989
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,410
Because that's why some of
those people said...

990
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,076
I'd pushed him

991
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,338
But I swear I didn't! I swear!

992
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,347
I believe you, Camilla

993
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:53,112
But a jury would need evidence

994
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,812
My word of honor!

995
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,890
I'm sorry, that's not evidence

996
01:14:58,093 --> 01:14:59,082
Listen

997
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:00,623
You met no one at the cathedral?

998
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,920
Think hard

999
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,964
No, just some dumb tourists

1000
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,759
With lots of cameras

1001
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,666
Cameras!

1002
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:12,567
We might find a lead

1003
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:13,638
I'll look

1004
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,104
But it'll take time

1005
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,173
Our only chance

1006
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,063
There you are

1007
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,325
It's no use

1008
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,129
but I've got a good lead

1009
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:20,532
A man filmed the church that day

1010
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:25,275
And I have his name

1011
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,933
Could we see Mr. Farrell?

1012
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,109
But Mr. Farrell is dead

1013
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:04,919
Oh, we're sorry

1014
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,419
We didn't know your husband was dead

1015
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,515
Not my husband, my son

1016
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,191
He was very ill

1017
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,119
It was hopeless

1018
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:15,523
You knew him?

1019
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,558
No, we knew film-making

1020
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,664
It was his hobby

1021
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:23,098
He filmed the cathedral

1022
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:26,773
That's my nephew, Michou
is crazy about films

1023
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,134
His work has won prizes

1024
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,946
I'll call him

1025
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:42,580
You filmed the cathedral?

1026
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,291
Yes, sir

1027
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,790
Can we see it?

1028
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:46,858
No

1029
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,053
Why?

1030
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,423
It's in rushes

1031
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:51,461
What?

1032
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,998
It's not edited yet

1033
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,429
Never mind

1034
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,798
I won't show it unfinished

1035
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,335
It doesn't matter

1036
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,140
We'll forget it

1037
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,206
I refuse

1038
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:03,901
A man died

1039
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,168
A life depends on our seeing

1040
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,142
Will you show it?

1041
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,975
Well, okay

1042
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:12,144
That's out of focus

1043
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,987
Someone pushed me, that's why

1044
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,024
The focus is okay now

1045
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,633
See the zoom?

1046
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:31,035
It's them!

1047
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,741
He's pull her...

1048
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:37,011
Nice zoom, huh?

1049
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,339
He talks to her...

1050
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,879
He let go...

1051
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,709
He goes ahead

1052
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,122
She steps back

1053
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,120
The proof! It's there!

1054
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,951
She's innocent!

1055
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,856
Oh Helen, I must kiss you!

1056
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,498
It's wonderful, Michou!

1057
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:05,573
Thanks to you,
a wrong will be righted!

1058
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:06,364
Congratulations!

1059
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:07,369
Not bad

1060
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,908
Camilla Bliss is innocent!

1061
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,602
Camilla Bliss is free!

1062
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,405
Camilla sings!

1063
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:15,879
Camilla is a star!

1064
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,122
Some people figger

1065
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:25,757
I'm just a gold-digger

1066
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,859
Natch, I don't give it away

1067
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:30,824
I make them pay

1068
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,498
But one day...

1069
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,635
I'll leave it to science

1070
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,234
The Aga Khan

1071
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,937
And Shah of Iran

1072
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:39,936
Promise me the sky

1073
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,505
Can't understand why

1074
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,075
I'd just as soon be

1075
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:50,044
A gorgeous kid like me

1076
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,912
I don't keep track

1077
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,847
Never look back

1078
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,349
Tear up their letters

1079
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:57,123
To forget them better

1080
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,590
When it's done, it's over

1081
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,990
How many kisses

1082
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:05,893
How many misses

1083
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,795
Before I met you

1084
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,902
How many clowns

1085
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:14,631
How many towns

1086
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:18,073
For a gorgeous kid like me

1087
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,643
How many kisses

1088
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:21,678
How many misses

1089
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,681
For a gorgeous kid like me

1090
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:33,752
It's you. Flowers again?

1091
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,519
Extra! A crime of passion!

1092
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,990
Love nest slaying

1093
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:09,755
Killer of Camilla's husband...

1094
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,555
Arrested by police...

1095
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,769
Is a sociologist!

1096
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,995
Get your special edition!

1097
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,117
You could've given it to me

1098
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,345
Sorry, I didn't think

1099
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,926
I'll read you my statement

1100
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:40,692
Tell me if it's quite clear

1101
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,729
Here is my statement

1102
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:48,093
In relating that disastrous evening

1103
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:52,270
I will rely solely on the truth

1104
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:59,240
It happened in the night club

1105
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,711
Oh, it's you. Flowers again?

1106
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:27,705
Was I good?

1107
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,138
Wonderful! Better than yesterday

1108
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:31,810
Lovely

1109
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:33,974
Help me get these off

1110
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:36,676
Let's have some champagne!

1111
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,443
Well... I don't drink

1112
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:44,353
It's not liquor, just lemonade
for grown ups

1113
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,003
See what I have here

1114
01:22:56,738 --> 01:23:00,265
The galleys of my thesis

1115
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:05,203
Who's the writer, you or me?

1116
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,778
Both, but mostly you

1117
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:12,150
So that motherfucker grabbed my ass

1118
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:13,385
And I ran in the can

1119
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:15,622
But she shoved me in the hay

1120
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:20,227
Shit, that's crummy style
for a professor

1121
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:23,193
They're your own words

1122
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,797
Rejecting your personality

1123
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,027
Okay you know best, I guess

1124
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:32,734
I thought maybe...

1125
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:34,340
We could go out tonight

1126
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,306
Look, I've got this headache

1127
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,141
Could you take me home?

1128
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,976
But let's have another one

1129
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:45,980
For the road

1130
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:50,754
I took her home

1131
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:53,017
Feeling highly emotional

1132
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,352
And a little drunk

1133
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,927
I thought Camilla was responding to me

1134
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,897
Discreetly, of course

1135
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:07,337
And that her headache was
a charming pretext to invite me in

1136
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,075
What's the matter, Stan?

1137
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,717
You look funny

1138
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:29,057
Maybe your girl knows how to type

1139
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:35,294
But intimacy-wise
she ain't much of a deal

1140
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,729
The moment her flesh touched mine

1141
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:09,367
I fainted

1142
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:15,669
I whispered her name

1143
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:16,603
And then it happened

1144
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,707
The tragedy

1145
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:25,352
Honey! We're rich! Look! I got money!

1146
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,578
Ma had an accident in the cellar

1147
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,689
Look what she left!

1148
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,661
Who's that bum?

1149
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,121
Music man, eh?

1150
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,128
I'll make you sing, Charlie!

1151
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:43,303
Out! Beat it!

1152
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,074
Music man my ass!

1153
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,110
You lousy tramp! Come here!

1154
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,445
Give me that gun!

1155
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:03,816
Camilla! No! Don't! Camilla!

1156
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:27,141
I never committed adultery
with Mrs. Bliss

1157
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:29,610
Though I contemplated it

1158
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:32,751
Nevertheless I am certain of one thing

1159
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:37,458
I did not shoot Mr. Bliss!

1160
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,455
There! Is it clear?

1161
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,653
Is it convincing?

1162
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:46,355
You did right
I'd have bumped them both

1163
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:50,632
You don't understand
I'm innocent!

1164
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,898
Look, I'll start over again

1165
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:57,271
Hey, professor!
A visit

1166
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:12,053
Look what I brought you

1167
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:27,068
Help me Camilla!

1168
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:28,333
Tell them the truth!

1169
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:29,270
The what?

1170
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,435
I didn't kill Clovis

1171
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:33,237
You know that!

1172
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:35,506
I'm not saying you did it

1173
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:36,943
Tell them it was an accident

1174
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,153
You claim you saw nothing because
you fainted

1175
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:44,255
But I'm the one who fainted, not you

1176
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:46,993
I don't remember

1177
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,589
Let's forget it

1178
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,388
It hurts you, and me too

1179
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:54,827
For me, the accident bit is out

1180
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:58,263
First, Pa, with the ladder

1181
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,372
Then Arthur, now Clovis

1182
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:05,043
They'd crucify me!

1183
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,542
Look, honey

1184
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:08,042
Think about me

1185
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,807
To exist

1186
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:11,910
And listen

1187
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:14,211
Everything has its good side

1188
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:15,879
Take me for instance

1189
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:18,615
It's thanks to jail I'm a star

1190
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:22,523
So now maybe you can write
a great book?

1191
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,826
Jail's funny

1192
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:32,705
There's them that know and
them that don't

1193
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,207
So now you know, just like me

1194
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,971
Mr. Previn

1195
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,378
Got a pass?

1196
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:46,246
No, I haven't
but I'm his secretary

1197
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:48,285
I know his lawyer

1198
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:50,113
That's no reason

1199
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,655
You need a pass

1200
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:55,225
You've got to ask the judge

1201
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:58,957
He'll give you one if you're family

1202
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,773
Get my lawyer!

1203
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:19,510
She told me she'd rigged the old oven
in Isabel's cellar!

1204
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,790
Later on they found her dead!

1205
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:25,250
You know why

1206
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:29,062
It worked like a time bomb!

1207
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:31,024
You know what?

1208
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:33,827
We'll blackmail her

1209
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:38,027
Either she changes her testimony

1210
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:41,403
Or we search Isabel's home to prove
that Camilla rigged the oven!

1211
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:44,143
Evidence!

1212
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,279
I'll tell her that!

1213
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,516
You're my last hope

1214
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:51,685
Everyone's let me down

1215
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:56,080
You'll do it for me?

1216
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,658
It's not only a matter of friendship
and ethics

1217
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:05,697
I'd truly enjoy crushing that creature

1218
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,492
Our new star of song

1219
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:38,494
Returns to her slum neighborhood

1220
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:52,145
Camilla Bliss knew hard times
in this garage

1221
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:57,113
She now owns the whole block!

1222
01:30:57,552 --> 01:31:00,180
Right! It's all mine

1223
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:15,659
Explain your generous gesture
on account of that man

1224
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,168
Come on!

1225
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:22,104
He's the one who gave me the idea

1226
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,713
He's my friend, my advisor, my agent

1227
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:28,411
He'll tell you, better

1228
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,717
In a minute

1229
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:35,820
These old buildings will be razed

1230
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:41,686
Mrs. Bliss doesn't merely wish to erase
cruel memories

1231
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:45,660
We thought of those poor children

1232
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:48,936
who never had a chance to swim

1233
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:53,665
On this site will be built
a swimming pool

1234
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,202
33 yards long

1235
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:57,707
33 yards!

1236
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:03,245
And now

1237
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:06,249
Your favorite request program,
Old Songs for all...

1238
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:08,749
From Mary to baby

1239
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,617
From Louse to Uncle Zef

1240
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:12,120
Jack for Stanley

1241
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:14,384
From Bernadette to Nicolo

1242
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,493
From Dudu to Martine

1243
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,596
Walter for Crieri

1244
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,733
From William to Claire

1245
01:32:20,968 --> 01:32:23,129
And Counne for Balthay

1246
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:27,465
I shall wait

1247
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:32,542
All night and all day

1248
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,008
I shall always wait

1249
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:39,751
For your return

1250
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:43,612
I shall wait

1251
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:48,358
Since the day you are gone

1252
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:52,224
Time stands still

1253
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:55,902
While I wait

1254
01:32:56,237 --> 01:33:04,406
For the day I'll see you once again

1255
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:08,112
The blues won't fly away

1256
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:12,546
Until that day

1257
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:17,382
I shall wait
