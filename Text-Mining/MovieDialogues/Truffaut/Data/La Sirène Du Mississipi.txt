Reunion is a small island

27
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:15,681
it was known successively

''This film is dedicated
to Jean Renoir''

39
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:42,060
Good morning. Please, tell
Monsieur Mahé that I'm here.

40
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:44,072
Of course, sir.

41
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,641
Monsieur Mahé,
Mister Jardine is here.

42
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:51,043
He's waiting for you downstairs.

43
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:53,446
Monsieur Mahé
will be right down.

44
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:56,781
So today's the great day?

45
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,946
Come on, don't be so mysterious.
Everybody knows.

46
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,286
Don't people have
anything else to do?

47
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:05,453
- Is what they say true?
- I don't know what they say.

48
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,462
They say he's never seen
his bride.

49
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,464
That he doesn't even know
what she looks like.

50
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:12,524
Of course he does. They must
have exchanged pictures.

51
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:34,218
Here's his breakfast.
He didn't even touch it.

52
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,986
There, you see how excited
he is, Monsieur Jardine.

53
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,429
You know, one of my aunts
got married by correspondence.

54
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:43,125
I'm all packed.

55
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,497
I'll send someone to pick up
the bags and pay the bill.

56
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:47,763
- Did you go by the house?
- Yes, the blinds came.

57
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,771
We're not going to be late,
are we?

58
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,139
I'll go with you as far as Ling Wo's.
You can drop me off there.

59
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:57,612
- Whose?
- The jeweller.

60
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:02,281
Did you know that out of
the 14 jewellers in this town...

61
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:04,752
eleven are Chinese,
and three, Creoles?

62
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:08,288
I almost forgot to give you
the bouquet.

63
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:10,417
- What bouquet?
- The bridal bouquet.

64
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:12,688
I completely forgot about it.

65
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:16,095
My wife reminded me
this morning. It's in here.

66
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:30,135
Good-bye. I'll come by
this evening to pay. Thank you.

67
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,112
Here's the ring.

68
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,449
That's the little string
she sent you for the size.

69
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,512
I suppose you'll want to keep it
as a souvenir.

70
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,922
I don't keep souvenirs.
It's the ring that matters.

71
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,964
Excuse me.

72
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,066
Excuse me.

73
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:35,759
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:44,906
Are there any other passengers?

75
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,737
No, Monsieur.
There's nobody else on board.

76
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,743
All the passengers are ashore.

77
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:29,141
Don't you recognize me,
Monsieur Mahé?

78
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,718
I'm sorry.

79
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,725
What do you mean by that?

80
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:45,766
I am Julie.
I am Julie Roussel.

81
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,963
Julie Roussel?

82
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,097
I don't understand.

83
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,801
You don't think
I'm like my picture?

84
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:59,338
The picture I sent you
wasn't really of me.

85
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,610
It was one of my friends.

86
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:05,917
It's hard to confide
in someone in a letter.

87
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:08,388
I was pleased
with your letters, but--

88
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:10,823
Well, especially at first
I was a bit afraid of you.

89
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:13,728
That's why.

90
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:16,594
But then,
after you had proposed to--

91
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,066
I mean, when you'd asked me
to marry you...

92
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:22,070
I was too embarrassed
to send a real picture of me.

93
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:23,662
And besides,
Berthe, my sister, said...

94
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:26,435
''When Monsieur Mahé sees you,
he will forgive you.''

95
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,307
Your sister's absolutely right.

96
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:30,902
You're not disappointed?

97
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,781
Look at me. Do I look
disappointed? You see...

98
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:40,951
I thought I'd already come
part of the way...

99
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:42,957
but I'm afraid it's not true.

100
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,425
I'll have to readjust myself
to you.

101
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:48,054
I must learn to know you.

102
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,293
Do you forgive Julie Roussel
for lying?

103
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,631
I find it charming.

104
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:05,176
Your plans?
Will this affect them?

105
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:08,081
- And yours?
- I'm here.

106
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,714
It's difficult, isn't it?

107
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:47,949
What's so difficult?

108
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,618
It's really hard
to get to know someone...

109
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,594
even if we told each other
a lot of things in our letters.

110
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,966
Exactly because we have
told each other a lot...

111
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:07,702
there will surely be
some big silences between us.

112
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:10,177
But that doesn't bother me.

113
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,180
Me neither.

114
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,666
I hope Reunion won't disappoint you.

115
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,738
I don't know New Caledonia.
I've never been to Noumea.

116
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,966
Where you're from
is a long strip of land.

117
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:42,408
Very long.

118
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,379
Whereas Reunion is shaped
like an egg.

119
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,575
By the way, do you know
how Reunion was populated?

120
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,049
No.

121
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:51,985
Three hundred years ago,
there was hardly anyone.

122
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:54,887
And Colbert,
who'd founded the India Company...

123
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,152
decided to send 1,000 settlers...

124
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:59,057
and 32 women.

125
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,426
During the voyage
there were many storms...

126
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:03,328
and a scurvy epidemic.

127
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,526
So when the boat docked...

128
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:08,593
there were many dead bodies
and sick people too.

129
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:10,832
And among the 32 women...

130
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:14,842
the only five remaining
got married within three months.

131
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,175
And one of them
was my great-great grandmother.

132
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:21,273
Who were these women?
Did they come here to marry?

133
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,716
I doubt anyone asked their opinion.

134
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,845
Many came from La Rochelle.

135
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:28,754
They were orphans, like you.

136
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,559
But I'm not sure
they were as beautiful.

137
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:59,543
This is our house.
This is where we'll live.

138
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,249
Our house?

139
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:03,587
Yes, I have a confession
to make.

140
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,627
I didn't tell you everything
in my letters.

141
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:09,061
- I'm afraid that I even lied.
- What do you mean you lied?

142
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,895
I told you that I was a foreman
in a factory making cigarettes.

143
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,195
Yes, you did.

144
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,363
That's not true.
I'm the owner of the factory.

145
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:20,000
I inherited it when my parents
died three years ago.

146
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,943
I'm not proud of myself
for hiding it...

147
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:25,674
but I hoped money
wouldn't enter into it.

148
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:28,649
I'm afraid your lie
is much nicer than mine.

149
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,844
- I hope you're not angry.
- No, Monsieur.

150
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,444
Not Monsieur, Louis.

151
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,546
No, Louis, it's not important
at all.

152
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:37,023
Besides,
I don't understand business.

153
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,990
Louis Mahé...

154
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:43,589
do you take for your lawfully
wedded wife, Julie Roussel...

155
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,464
here present,
according to the rites...

156
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,060
of our mother, the Holy Church?

157
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,469
I do.

158
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:54,908
Julie Roussel, do you take for
your lawfully wedded husband...

159
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:57,502
Louis Mahé, here present...

160
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,845
according to the rites
of our mother, the Holy Church?

161
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,974
I do.

162
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,541
I now pronounce you
man and wife...

163
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,520
in the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

164
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:08,113
Amen.

165
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,090
You may kiss the bride.

166
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,577
What's the matter?

167
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,547
What's wrong with you?

168
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:22,049
What's wrong?

169
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:24,517
Julie, answer me!

170
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,713
What is it?

171
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,304
There.

172
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,252
Any better?

173
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:06,419
Yes.

174
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:11,295
Yes, I'm much better.

175
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,966
It seemed you were having
trouble breathing.

176
00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:16,902
Yes.

177
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:20,032
- Has this happened before?
- Yes.

178
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:26,704
I was embarrassed to tell you...

179
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:32,077
I'm unable to sleep
without a lamp on.

180
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:34,884
I can't sleep in the dark!

181
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:37,721
You should've said so.
It's simple.

182
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:39,727
We'll leave
the lamp on the table lit.

183
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:44,198
No, it's too bright.
It might keep you awake.

184
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,564
Shall I leave the light
in the bathroom on?

185
00:20:46,635 --> 00:20:48,466
Yes, would you, please?

186
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:53,036
There we are.

187
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:55,906
- Is that better?
- Yes.

188
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:58,845
You're like those little
children who can't sleep...

189
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:01,542
without a door open
or a light on.

190
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:04,051
And who say, ''Leave the door
open a little wider...

191
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,384
a little more, more.

192
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:10,084
There, like that.''

193
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,095
You've had enough of
this little cage, haven't you?

194
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:22,501
You'll be happier in here.

195
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,107
Look, no, come on.

196
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,669
That one's better.

197
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:31,611
Come here, come here.
Come on.

198
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,773
It's bigger than this one.

199
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:43,955
Here we go. That's right.
Get on your perch.

200
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,128
That's better, huh?

201
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,579
I'd like you to meet my wife.

202
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,782
Do you already know my wife?

203
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:18,884
Please allow me
to introduce my wife.

204
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,895
I believe you know my wife.

205
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:22,931
You've met my charming wife?

206
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,431
Here she is now.

207
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,297
Please allow me
to introduce her.

208
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:29,303
- She's charming, ravishing--
- Louis, you are crazy!

209
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,734
Thank you, Sarah.
Don't forget my canary.

210
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,746
Louis, breakfast.

211
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:48,951
Why are you having coffee?

212
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:51,049
It'll only take a minute
for Sarah to make tea.

213
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:53,720
No, no, I love coffee.

214
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:57,060
Oh, really. I remember
that in one of your letters...

215
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,191
you told me
that you preferred tea.

216
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:01,759
I wrote a lot of things.

217
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:07,307
Are you still planning
to show me the factory tomorrow?

218
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:10,311
Absolutely. You must meet
all the personnel.

219
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,609
I am so proud of you.

220
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:15,081
But I have nothing to wear.

221
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,118
What about the trunk
that just came?

222
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:20,484
My trunk?
Oh, it's only old things.

223
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:23,992
Well, you must open it
sometime.

224
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:26,961
I've lost the key.

225
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,020
Call a locksmith.

226
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:30,997
But it's Sunday.

227
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:34,502
That's right. It's Sunday.
I'd forgotten all about it.

228
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:46,112
When my grandfather owned this
plantation, it was much bigger.

229
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:49,082
But it has been divided
among his heirs.

230
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,619
Aren't they pretty? I didn't
know that tobacco had flowers.

231
00:23:51,687 --> 00:23:54,815
Oh, yes. When they're in bloom,
they're no good anymore.

232
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,188
There, you see?
They are uprooting them now.

233
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:59,193
Do you make your cigarettes
out of this tobacco?

234
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,889
It's mixed
with five other tobaccos...

235
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:04,797
which come from Madagascar
and the West Indies.

236
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:33,422
Look, Monsieur Louis,
Madame Julie's bird is dead.

237
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,038
Julie, are you there?

238
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,140
Yes, I'm taking a bath.

239
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:58,550
- I have bad news.
- What is it?

240
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,713
Your canary's dead.

241
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:04,953
That doesn't surprise me a bit.
He hasn't been himself for days.

242
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:57,106
Louis, can you help me
button up my dress?

243
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,114
I can never manage it.

244
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,556
I wonder why I wear this dress,
I can never button it up.

245
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:17,427
There.

246
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,524
It's my favourite,
do you like it?

247
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:23,730
Yes. The lace is nice.

248
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:27,398
It's embroidery, it's not lace.

249
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:33,807
You seem very far away today.

250
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:38,216
Oh, no, even if I wanted to,
I couldn't be far away.

251
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:58,806
You are adorable.

252
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:20,092
Wait, wait. Come over here
under the Wishing Tree.

253
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:21,754
- The Wishing Tree?
- Yes.

254
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,525
What's that?

255
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,361
I'll tell you all about it.

256
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:27,594
Sit down.

257
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:28,863
There.

258
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:32,497
It's a very old
family tradition.

259
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:37,068
Whenever we make a wish
under this tree, it's granted.

260
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,308
Really? I'm going to make a wish
here too, then.

261
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:41,872
So will I.

262
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:45,515
- Well, I already made mine.
- So did I.

263
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:48,852
- Wouldn't it be funny if we--
- If we made the same wish?

264
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:01,728
Here, take this note in.

265
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,115
Let me go, you bastard!

266
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,212
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

267
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:04,690
- This is a huge bank.
- Yes. There are 164 employees.

268
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,490
Of the 47 banks on the island,
this is the biggest one.

269
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:10,758
I'd better ask the cashier.

270
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,562
Monsieur Hoareau, please?

271
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,466
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Monsieur Mahé.

272
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:18,097
I'm sorry
if I kept you waiting.

273
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:21,606
Madame.

274
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:22,938
How are you, sir?

275
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:25,639
I was trimming the Christmas
tree for the staff.

276
00:30:26,982 --> 00:30:29,212
And how can I help you?

277
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:33,653
I would like my wife to have
complete access to my account.

278
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,713
Nothing could be easier.
All we have to do is...

279
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,657
change your present account
to a joint account.

280
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:41,890
To do that I shall need
both your signatures.

281
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,828
Yours on the bottom
of this form...

282
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:45,593
giving us the authorization.

283
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:48,295
And yours, Madame,
on this signature card...

284
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,099
so that we will have it on file.

285
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:52,662
My wife and money
don't get along at all.

286
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:56,006
She's too shy to keep asking me
when she needs it.

287
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:57,704
So we thought--

288
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,974
That is, I thought,
it would be easier like this.

289
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:02,949
Absolutely. But I'd like
to clarify one other thing.

290
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:06,784
Will these conditions apply to your
personal account or to both accounts?

291
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:08,846
- I think the personal one.
- Yes, yes, of course.

292
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:10,220
No, both.

293
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,418
In that case, will you sign
this second power of attorney?

294
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,895
I've heard a lot about how
beautiful you are, Madame...

295
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:20,400
but I see
they were understatements.

296
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:24,165
I hope you and Madame Hoareau
will join us for dinner at home.

297
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:26,764
You too, Monsieur Jardine,
with Madame.

298
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:50,396
- What day is it today?
- Friday.

299
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:52,558
I was hoping it was Sunday.

300
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:55,034
Before I met you,
I didn't like holidays...

301
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:58,129
and now I'm beginning to hate
the days when I have to work.

302
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:14,980
Julie, you are adorable.

303
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:18,648
You know what that means?
''Adorable.''

304
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:21,661
It means ''worthy of adoration.''

305
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,355
Adorable.

306
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:22,389
I have a registered letter
for you.

307
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,898
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.

308
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:46,809
Monsieur Mahé,
Since my sister Julie left...

309
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:50,146
l have written four times
without any reply.

310
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:52,345
Something must have happened
to her.

311
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,047
I demand an explanation.

312
00:33:54,122 --> 00:33:56,386
I must know
where my sister is.

313
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:59,017
I'm writing to you
as a last resort.

314
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:02,551
Let me know immediately
where she is.

315
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,621
Prove to me
that nothing's the matter.

316
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:08,157
I want you to see that she gets
in touch with me at once.

317
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:11,467
If not, I'll go to the police.
Berthe Roussel.

318
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,376
Get me Madame Mahé.

319
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:27,578
Monsieur Berber is wanted
in Accounting.

320
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,384
Madame Mahé is on the phone.

321
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,588
That's fine. Leave me alone.

322
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:45,229
-Julie?
- Yes.

323
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,536
There's something
you must tell me.

324
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,304
I've just received a letter
from your sister.

325
00:34:49,377 --> 00:34:51,971
She complains that you haven't
written since you left.

326
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,276
Ah yes, that's true.
She's perfectly right.

327
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:56,078
Ive been about to write
a dozen times...

328
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,947
but something always comes up.

329
00:34:58,019 --> 00:34:59,884
Getting everything
running smoothly--

330
00:34:59,954 --> 00:35:02,923
But after all, Julie,
she's your sister.

331
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:06,017
And besides, the tone of
her letter is extremely violent.

332
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:08,619
That doesn't surprise me.
Ill write her tomorrow.

333
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:11,062
But why tomorrow?
You must write now.

334
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,929
Yes. That's right.
That's what Ill do.

335
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:14,400
- Good-bye, Julie.
- Wait.

336
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:16,664
Wait. Im thinking about you.

337
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:18,228
Me too.

338
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:20,365
- l miss you.
- Me too.

339
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,841
- Very much.
- Me too.

340
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:49,669
Julie.

341
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,800
Julie.

342
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:05,684
- Sarah, have you seen Madame?
- No, Monsieur.

343
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,466
l would like my wife to have
complete access to my account.

344
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:03,470
Nothing could be easier.

345
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:12,211
l must speak
to Monsieur Hoareau.

346
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,248
its very important,
l absolutely must speak to him.

347
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:16,476
The bank is closed.

348
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,485
its me, Louis Mahé.
l must speak to you.

349
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:20,817
Jeremy, let Monsieur Mahé in.

350
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:27,489
its very important. l must know
how much is in my account.

351
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:29,223
l don't understand,
Monsieur Mahé.

352
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:32,528
No one can touch your money,
except you and your wife.

353
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,127
The cashier can give you this
information tomorrow morning.

354
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:39,002
l can't wait.
Look in the files yourself.

355
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:43,239
This morning you had
28 million in your account.

356
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:46,838
l know that. l knew it already.
Tell me how much is in it now!

357
00:38:48,716 --> 00:38:52,083
Your wife came in this afternoon
15 minutes before closing time.

358
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:55,987
She withdrew 27,850,000 francs.

359
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:58,651
You have therefore
150,000 francs.

360
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:00,353
To close out the account...

361
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:02,453
we would have required
your signature, too.

362
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:46,092
- Monsieur Mahé?
- Yes.

363
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,601
I am Berthe Roussel,
Julie's sister.

364
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:54,130
I don't know anything.
You see, I've just closed the house.

365
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:58,008
You won't need your taxi.
We can go into town in my car.

366
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,552
No, that's not my sister.
It's incredible.

367
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,079
As soon as l opened
that trunk...

368
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:09,412
l realized that the things
that were in it...

369
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:12,941
could have never belonged
to the woman I had married.

370
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,480
I rushed to the bank,
the Bank of Reunion...

371
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:21,585
and as I expected, she had
disappeared during the day.

372
00:42:21,662 --> 00:42:23,596
She took everything.

373
00:42:23,664 --> 00:42:25,859
She cleaned out
both my accounts.

374
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:29,801
The company's account
and my personal account.

375
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,967
Naturally, I assume you went
straight to the police.

376
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:37,670
I did. But the police,
I'm afraid, are powerless...

377
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:40,339
to act against her because
I'm married to the woman.

378
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:42,712
Unless we can prove she is not
the real Julie Roussel.

379
00:42:42,783 --> 00:42:45,217
I can prove it.

380
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:48,414
The woman who married
Monsieur Mahé is not my sister.

381
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:52,016
I took my sister to the boat.
I saw her off on the Mississippi.

382
00:42:52,093 --> 00:42:55,460
When the boat arrived here,
she was not on board.

383
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:57,656
It is clear
she never came ashore.

384
00:42:57,732 --> 00:43:00,394
She would never have gone
so long without writing me.

385
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:04,336
I'm afraid that there is no hope
of finding her alive.

386
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:06,339
What do you expect me to do?

387
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:10,809
Forgive me
for speaking brutally.

388
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:14,642
We want you to find the proof
that there was a murder.

389
00:43:14,715 --> 00:43:17,684
We want you to find the criminal
and to arrest her.

390
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:21,950
- We want her brought to trial.
- I accept.

391
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:25,657
This case
interests me very much.

392
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:29,594
It's not run-of-the-mill
like the ones I usually get.

393
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:33,530
I must warn you, however,
that I can't tell you...

394
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:36,263
how much time it will take me
to solve this case.

395
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:38,965
I can promise you that I only
accept one case at a time...

396
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,305
and I'll keep working on it
until I have solved it.

397
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:45,811
To begin with...

398
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,475
I shall take the same trip
that Julie Roussel took.

399
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,313
I shall book passage
on the Mississippi...

400
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:53,216
and inquire everybody...

401
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:56,347
about a woman passenger
who made the trip with a canary.

402
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:04,555
Of course I must be able
to contact one of you.

403
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:06,156
I'm going to be away
for a while.

404
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:08,098
I think somewhere
in the South of France.

405
00:44:08,169 --> 00:44:10,637
My partner, Monsieur Jardine,
will always know where I am.

406
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:13,172
I'm leaving for Noumea today.
Here is my address.

407
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,300
I'll write you a check.
How much will you need?

408
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:17,901
Make it out
for whatever you wish.

409
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:21,141
- If it isn't enough--
-Just a second.

410
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:22,944
Oh no, you mustn't,
Mademoiselle Roussel.

411
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:24,882
It's up to me to pay for this.

412
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:27,386
Please, this is no time to be
polite. She was my sister...

413
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:29,479
and it's my right
to share the expenses with you.

414
00:44:29,557 --> 00:44:31,787
You can't take that
away from me.

415
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:44,102
If you don't mind, I will have
to cut up this picture.

416
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:47,140
I'll need it
for my investigation.

417
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:51,907
We will see each other again,
Monsieur Mahé.

418
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:57,480
We'll see each other again
one of these days, I'm sure.

419
00:44:57,551 --> 00:45:00,952
There's no point
in having people gossip.

420
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,319
At the end of every week...

421
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,153
I'll send you all the news
of the factory.

422
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:09,720
General Delivery in Marseilles,
until you have an address.

423
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:13,324
A Boeing. Out of the six flights
every week...

424
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,460
there are four Boeings
and two D.C. 8's.

425
00:45:16,537 --> 00:45:18,471
Have a good rest.

426
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,018
What am I doing here?

427
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:24,030
You're in a hospital,
Monsieur Mahé. In Nice.

428
00:47:24,098 --> 00:47:27,397
- Have you been to Nice before?
- But why am I here?

429
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:31,564
You were exhausted.
You've been having a sleeping cure.

430
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:34,402
If I'm having a sleeping cure,
why do you wake me all the time?

431
00:47:34,475 --> 00:47:37,603
- We've got to feed you.
- I'm not hungry.

432
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:40,977
Let me help you walk a bit.
If we don't, you'll get too weak.

433
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:45,085
I don't feel very rested...

434
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:47,143
because I have these dreams
all the time.

435
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:49,689
That's because of the shots
we have to give you.

436
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:51,554
What do you dream?

437
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,752
It's always the same dream.

438
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:56,853
I'm driving my car and I see
all the these women in white...

439
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,728
very tall, and they're
in the middle of the road...

440
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,064
waving their arms,
not frightened.

441
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:06,072
No. It's more like-- more like
they are doing a slow dance.

442
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,233
And I'm afraid
I'm going to hit them.

443
00:48:09,743 --> 00:48:12,075
That's enough for now. You're
walking better than yesterday.

444
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:14,114
You'll be able to go out
in the garden soon.

445
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:15,842
Come and lie down.

446
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:31,654
- Would you like a newspaper?
- No newspaper, thank you.

447
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:33,256
Are you expecting a visitor?

448
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,528
No, I don't know anybody
in France.

449
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:40,433
And that is all
the political news for now.

450
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:42,668
Next, a few items
of local interest.

451
00:48:42,743 --> 00:48:45,769
A new night club has just opened
on the Riviera...

452
00:48:45,846 --> 00:48:48,974
where the people from Antibes
can spend a happy evening.

453
00:48:49,049 --> 00:48:52,018
The Phoenix recently opened
to the public...

454
00:48:52,086 --> 00:48:54,020
on the lovely
Jacques Audiberti Square.

455
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:55,885
Charming hostesses
are on hand to dance...

456
00:48:55,956 --> 00:48:59,949
with those unlucky gentlemen
who may be feeling lonely.

457
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:04,088
Here then is the swinging
atmosphere at the Phoenix.

458
00:51:21,902 --> 00:51:24,769
Good evening, sir.
Care to take a little look inside?

459
00:53:35,163 --> 00:53:36,858
That's enough. Go home now.

460
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:39,127
- Oh no, you said ''to the door.''
- No, no, to the stairs.

461
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:40,930
Why can't I come to the door?

462
00:53:41,003 --> 00:53:44,495
All right,
but I don't want you to--

463
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:46,268
Better than that.
Come on, better than that.

464
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:49,640
- You'll ruin my stockings.
- I'll buy you a dozen pairs.

465
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:51,508
- Go on.
- I just want to come in.

466
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,548
- No, no, some other time.
- Some other time?

467
00:53:53,615 --> 00:53:55,879
- Tomorrow night, then.
- Maybe, we'll see.

468
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:33,180
It's you, Louis?

469
00:54:33,255 --> 00:54:35,382
You've found me.

470
00:54:35,457 --> 00:54:36,719
Yes.

471
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:43,330
Why didn't you let that man
come in with you?

472
00:54:43,398 --> 00:54:44,729
Not enough money for you?

473
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:49,532
Do you remember what I told you
about Reunion?

474
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:52,835
About how it was populated
at first?

475
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:56,969
I told you about all those women
who'd come from France by boat.

476
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:59,036
Orphans, just like you.

477
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:03,346
Except that's only
what the guide books say.

478
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,978
For the tourists.

479
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:08,784
If you take a look at the records,
you'll find out...

480
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:12,793
they weren't orphans,
but prostitutes.

481
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:16,194
Did you come all the way here
to tell me that?

482
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:21,527
I came here to kill you.

483
00:55:22,437 --> 00:55:23,995
Turn around.

484
00:55:25,941 --> 00:55:30,878
You can kill me.
I'm willing to die.

485
00:55:32,948 --> 00:55:34,939
I'm waiting.

486
00:55:35,017 --> 00:55:37,611
I don't mind if you kill me.

487
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,888
Put this on.
You're almost naked.

488
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:50,087
Ever since you left, I've dreamt
of coming face to face with you.

489
00:55:50,165 --> 00:55:54,101
I've never asked myself whether
it would be easy to kill you.

490
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,001
I'm finding out it's not.

491
00:56:00,475 --> 00:56:03,706
A pistol doesn't work by magic.

492
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:05,576
There is a trigger.

493
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:07,410
I'm incapable of pulling it.

494
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:09,712
You're going to turn me over
to the police?

495
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:12,253
- Yes.
- No.

496
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,288
I'd have let you kill me,
but I'm not going to prison.

497
00:56:14,356 --> 00:56:17,587
I won't go back to prison.
Now you're going to listen to me.

498
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:19,354
Will you sit there
and not interrupt me?

499
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:20,861
Yes, Julie.

500
00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:22,863
No, don't call me Julie.
It's not my name.

501
00:56:22,931 --> 00:56:25,229
My name is Marion Vergano.

502
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,098
Remember. One day
you were angry with me...

503
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,468
because I wouldn't read a book
you wanted me to read.

504
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:34,373
You said I wasted my time on
trash like True Confessions.

505
00:56:34,443 --> 00:56:39,142
But my life was just like
the lives in those cheap magazines.

506
00:56:39,214 --> 00:56:42,843
Marion was the name somebody
gave me at the state orphanage.

507
00:56:42,918 --> 00:56:45,512
Vergano I found
on an Italian postcard.

508
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:47,487
It's the name of a village.

509
00:56:48,623 --> 00:56:50,454
When you get out
of the orphanage...

510
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:53,722
you are either brainwashed,
or completely rebellious.

511
00:56:53,795 --> 00:56:55,763
I threw myself into life.

512
00:56:55,831 --> 00:56:59,392
At fourteen, I got my first high
heels. A man bought them for me.

513
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:04,327
I got a job as a maid, so
I'd check the shoes in a bar...

514
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:06,806
and pick them up
on my next day off.

515
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,308
As soon as I got a new job...

516
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:12,210
I'd begin by lifting the change
from my boss's pocket.

517
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,215
Then I'd go on to the bills
in his wallet...

518
00:57:15,283 --> 00:57:18,309
and finally wind up by
leaving with the wallet itself.

519
00:57:19,955 --> 00:57:22,583
They sent me to reform schools,
each one tougher than the last.

520
00:57:22,657 --> 00:57:25,285
We had to undress before
going into the dormitory...

521
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,329
and leave our clothes
in the hall.

522
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:30,387
They locked the dormitory doors.

523
00:57:30,465 --> 00:57:33,059
Even the windows were sealed.

524
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:36,263
Between the guard's rounds,
we'd have a masturbation contest.

525
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:39,733
But the hardest part at first,
was to get used...

526
00:57:39,808 --> 00:57:42,538
to sleeping with the light on
all night.

527
00:57:44,913 --> 00:57:47,438
I've never been able to sleep
in the dark since.

528
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:52,581
I was pretty,
I could manage boys well.

529
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:55,179
I got what I wanted...

530
00:57:55,257 --> 00:57:58,090
until the day
that I met Richard.

531
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:02,219
I was with him
on the Mississippi...

532
00:58:02,297 --> 00:58:04,731
at the same time
as Julie Roussel.

533
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,357
Richard loved big boats.

534
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:09,028
There's always some con game
you can pull on them.

535
00:58:10,205 --> 00:58:14,972
So we met Julie Roussel,
your fiancée...

536
00:58:15,043 --> 00:58:17,102
and she confided in me.

537
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:21,411
She told me everything,
the exchange of letters...

538
00:58:21,483 --> 00:58:24,941
your future marriage,
she even showed me your picture.

539
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,612
At that moment, she said...

540
00:58:26,688 --> 00:58:31,057
''He wants me to believe he is
a foreman in a cigarette factory.

541
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:32,753
But I've done
some investigating.

542
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:35,489
And I've found out
the factory belongs to him.''

543
00:58:35,564 --> 00:58:37,395
She wasn't exactly
a plaster saint...

544
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:39,365
your Julie Roussel
with her canary.

545
00:58:40,902 --> 00:58:43,962
At first, Richard planned to
use her to get at your money...

546
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,736
but it seemed too complicated.

547
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:50,209
He decided to get rid of her.

548
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:54,973
So one night
he pushed her overboard.

549
00:58:56,251 --> 00:58:58,811
That was two days before
we got to Reunion.

550
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:07,659
Richard made me do
the craziest things imaginable.

551
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:09,390
But he overdid himself
when he asked me...

552
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:12,126
to take the place
of Julie Roussel.

553
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:17,699
The first time when I saw you
when I got off the Mississippi...

554
00:59:17,772 --> 00:59:22,232
I should have been in agony
or paralysed by fright.

555
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,802
Actually I felt nothing.
I was like a sleepwalker.

556
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,508
The rest I know.

557
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:31,711
You put on your act with me
from morning till night.

558
00:59:31,786 --> 00:59:33,447
Right up till you cleaned out
the accounts at the bank.

559
00:59:33,521 --> 00:59:36,217
No, that's not true. You don't
have the right to say that.

560
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:39,260
When I became your wife I tried
to be just like any other wife.

561
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:43,286
I tried to push out of my mind
what Richard wanted me to do.

562
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:47,233
When Richard came on shore
I didn't get in touch with him.

563
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:50,066
But of course it was easy
for him to find your address.

564
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:52,402
He bothered me constantly.

565
00:59:52,474 --> 00:59:56,171
Remember once you came home and
found me with a swollen face?

566
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:58,610
I made you believe that
I had fallen in the bathroom.

567
01:00:00,148 --> 01:00:02,639
He blackmailed me
and finally I gave in.

568
01:00:02,717 --> 01:00:04,548
I didn't want him
to turn me over to the police.

569
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:07,383
I thought he might kill us,
both, because he's mad.

570
01:00:08,923 --> 01:00:12,324
Where's the money?
What have you done with it?

571
01:00:12,394 --> 01:00:14,828
Richard took it
and dropped me afterward.

572
01:00:16,531 --> 01:00:18,624
You don't believe me?

573
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,565
Do you think I'd be a dance hall
hostess at the Phoenix...

574
01:00:20,635 --> 01:00:23,195
if I still had the 27 million?

575
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:30,176
I have no money at all, Louis.
That's the truth.

576
01:00:30,245 --> 01:00:33,510
I was just waiting to make
enough money at the Phoenix...

577
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:36,516
to get my ticket to Paris.

578
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:39,178
I've always thought
that I'd be lucky in Paris.

579
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:41,950
And besides I'm fed up here.

580
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:45,515
I went to see you at the Phoenix
one night.

581
01:00:45,593 --> 01:00:49,290
I hid in a corner
and watched you.

582
01:00:49,364 --> 01:00:51,457
I watched you dancing
with those other guys.

583
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:55,268
And your face had such
an expression of joy...

584
01:00:55,337 --> 01:00:57,805
it was incredible.

585
01:00:57,872 --> 01:01:00,466
An expression
that I'd never seen before.

586
01:01:03,044 --> 01:01:07,447
I knew then I had given you nothing.
That I had no place in your life.

587
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:08,948
You're absolutely wrong, Louis.

588
01:01:09,017 --> 01:01:11,417
I loved you
from the first minute we met.

589
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:15,081
A hundred times
I started to tell you.

590
01:01:15,156 --> 01:01:19,217
I always stopped at the last
moment because I'm a coward.

591
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:25,154
You do whatever you want,
but I did love you...

592
01:01:26,368 --> 01:01:28,233
I'm not really bad--

593
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:34,968
Wait.

594
01:01:35,043 --> 01:01:36,977
I'm waiting.

595
01:01:37,045 --> 01:01:39,070
I still love you.

596
01:01:40,148 --> 01:01:41,581
I believe you.

597
01:01:41,649 --> 01:01:43,708
No, it's not true.
You don't believe me.

598
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:47,949
Yes, I believe you...

599
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:49,956
and I love you.

600
01:01:58,032 --> 01:02:01,160
Look, Marion, the grey one.
That wouldn't be bad.

601
01:02:01,236 --> 01:02:03,295
Look at the red convertible.
It's super.

602
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:05,271
No, the red one would be
too conspicuous.

603
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,137
We'd better get the grey.

604
01:02:08,343 --> 01:02:10,140
Isn't there anything else?

605
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:16,742
Too bad. I prefer the red one.

606
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,911
No, Marion, we'll take the grey.

607
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,527
Will they be upset at the club
when I don't up show tonight?

608
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:37,336
Paris is 813 kilometers.
That's not very far.

609
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:41,136
No. If we drove all day,
we could be there tonight.

610
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:44,235
What's stopping us from going?
You promised to show me Paris.

611
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:46,974
No, it's not possible, Marion.

612
01:02:47,048 --> 01:02:50,381
You mustn't forget Comolli,
that detective from Reunion.

613
01:02:50,452 --> 01:02:52,249
He must still be on the case.

614
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,049
And even in a city like Paris...

615
01:02:54,122 --> 01:02:58,183
you're forced to fill out
a registration at all the hotels.

616
01:02:58,259 --> 01:03:02,423
I bet it was Jardine who told
you to go to that detective.

617
01:03:02,497 --> 01:03:06,797
It was Julie's sister,
Berthe Roussel.

618
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:09,996
It's true. Anyway, Jardine
never gives anybody advice.

619
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:12,130
He just hands out the figures.

620
01:03:12,207 --> 01:03:15,438
Know what he said to me
the day we got married?

621
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,877
He told me, ''Out of 89 religious
establishments in Reunion...

622
01:03:18,947 --> 01:03:23,281
there are 62 Catholic parishes,
twenty pagodas...

623
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:27,651
three mosques,
and four Adventist temples.''

624
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:32,289
If we can't go to a hotel,
we'll rent a house.

625
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,885
But it's so much work.
You need servants.

626
01:03:34,963 --> 01:03:38,455
I can keep a house on my own,
you know.

627
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:41,263
I can do the housework,
the cooking, and the--

628
01:03:41,336 --> 01:03:43,201
And the dishes,
and the washing.

629
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:45,933
Of course!
You'll see, I'll surprise you.

630
01:03:46,007 --> 01:03:48,305
That's right. Surprise me.

631
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,884
There, that's the house.

632
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:02,113
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

633
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,988
There. The woman
from the agency is waiting.

634
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:08,825
You know who she looks like?
Olive, Popeye's girl.

635
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:15,659
Madame and Monsieur Mahé,
I presume.

636
01:04:15,737 --> 01:04:17,864
Follow me, please,
I'll show you the house.

637
01:04:17,939 --> 01:04:19,600
I'm sure it will suit you
very well.

638
01:04:19,674 --> 01:04:22,199
You're lucky. You got here
just in time for the sunset.

639
01:04:22,277 --> 01:04:24,245
It's marvellous from the terrace.

640
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,381
I think you'll be very happy here.
The house is charming.

641
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,214
It's not very big
but it'll be fine for the two of you.

642
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:34,221
You'll see.
It's a little ''home, sweet home.''

643
01:04:34,289 --> 01:04:37,690
Here the owner had started to put in
a bar, but he never finished it.

644
01:04:37,759 --> 01:04:40,091
There you have a chimney
that works remarkably well.

645
01:04:40,161 --> 01:04:43,062
There's plenty of wood.
You'll need it with this weather.

646
01:04:43,131 --> 01:04:46,567
There's a very practical little piece
of furniture with a lamp...

647
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:49,535
and there's the library
with lots of books.

648
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:53,062
The owner will unfortunately
have to come for them soon.

649
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:55,109
I think I've told you everything.

650
01:04:55,176 --> 01:04:57,474
I'll give you the inventory.

651
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:58,944
- Good-bye, Madame.
- Good-bye.

652
01:04:59,013 --> 01:05:00,207
Good-bye, Monsieur.

653
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:03,409
If you need anything, just call me at
the agency. I'm there every afternoon.

654
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,884
Just ask for Madame Doyle.

655
01:05:24,072 --> 01:05:27,269
So, what do you think of
our little ''home, sweet home''?

656
01:05:27,342 --> 01:05:30,004
Yeah, what a character!
What was her name again?

657
01:05:30,078 --> 01:05:31,636
Madame Dahl?

658
01:05:31,713 --> 01:05:34,273
- No. Madame Doyle.
- Oh, right.

659
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:36,943
Doyle sounds kind of like Oyl!

660
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:38,815
Maybe it's ''d'Oyl,'' like nobility.

661
01:05:38,886 --> 01:05:42,788
Madame d'Oyl.
Madame Olive d'Oyl.

662
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:47,988
Tonight, Madame Olive d'Oyl will speak
to her fans, live from our studios.

663
01:05:48,062 --> 01:05:51,998
Hey, why did you brush me off
in front of her?

664
01:05:52,066 --> 01:05:54,796
I didn't see any reason
why she should look at you.

665
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:56,928
I didn't want her to see your thighs.

666
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:00,769
Did that annoy you?

667
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:04,676
No, no.
I rather liked it.

668
01:06:04,746 --> 01:06:07,977
I really wanted you,
right at that moment.

669
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,643
And I've been thinking about it
ever since.

670
01:06:16,924 --> 01:06:20,826
Would you like more coffee?
Even if I make you some toast?

671
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,954
It's time for my little cigar.

672
01:06:26,768 --> 01:06:28,702
Don't take the paper,
I haven't read it.

673
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,738
- There's nothing in it.
- Doesn't matter, let me see.

674
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:33,638
- No, no. There's nothing.
- Come on now, let me see.

675
01:06:34,842 --> 01:06:36,639
What's bothering you?

676
01:06:38,346 --> 01:06:39,608
Oh, that's it.

677
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:43,777
Dangerous criminal captured
after shooting at police.

678
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,916
Is it Richard?
The same one?

679
01:06:47,989 --> 01:06:51,083
That's right. It's him.
I didn't want to upset you.

680
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:56,528
I'm glad he shot at the cops.
Now he'll get at least ten years.

681
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:59,725
You shouldn't wish
ten years in prison on anyone...

682
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:01,530
even someone you don't like.

683
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:05,333
But I don't dislike him,
I hate him.

684
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:12,211
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, I want my brush.

685
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,272
Yeah, yeah, just a pretext,
a pretext.

686
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:18,546
I wish you'd hurry up
and lose your hair.

687
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:22,077
I've always been attracted
by men who are going bald.

688
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:24,920
That's because you never met
your father.

689
01:07:24,992 --> 01:07:27,859
You always have
such complicated explanations.

690
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:31,365
It's not complicated.
It's simple. It's pure logic.

691
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,780
I know what you're looking for.

692
01:07:51,853 --> 01:07:53,787
I've hidden it.

693
01:07:53,855 --> 01:07:56,688
You gotta find it. Go on.

694
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:02,285
Oh no. You're cold, cold,
you're cold.

695
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:04,490
Still very cold.

696
01:08:04,565 --> 01:08:07,591
Absolutely freezing!

697
01:08:09,103 --> 01:08:11,298
That's right
in the middle of Iceland.

698
01:08:11,372 --> 01:08:13,499
You're not helping a bit.

699
01:08:13,574 --> 01:08:16,634
Ah, it might be there,
but it isn't.

700
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:19,009
Oh no, no. Very cold.

701
01:08:20,615 --> 01:08:21,912
Lukewarm.

702
01:08:21,983 --> 01:08:24,008
You're getting a little warmer.

703
01:08:24,085 --> 01:08:27,111
Yes. You're getting hot.
Cold again!

704
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:29,620
- And here?
- Burning.

705
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,158
- Burning, burning.
- There it is! I found it!

706
01:08:32,226 --> 01:08:35,525
- Right, you owe me a penalty.
- You owe me. I found it.

707
01:08:35,596 --> 01:08:37,029
I practically told you
where it was.

708
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:39,225
But that's the game.
You lost, you pay.

709
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,359
- In any case there's a penalty.
- Yes, and you pay now.

710
01:08:41,435 --> 01:08:44,370
Stay here.
I have an idea for the penalty.

711
01:08:44,438 --> 01:08:47,498
First the ribbon. There we are.
Then the curtain.

712
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,525
Here.

713
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,537
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting my sweater on.

714
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:26,102
You might've told me.
Everybody can see you.

715
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,149
- But nobody's around.
- Nobody! There's a car coming.

716
01:09:29,217 --> 01:09:31,481
- That's too bad.
- So it's too bad, eh?

717
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:36,117
The poor guy panicked.

718
01:09:41,863 --> 01:09:43,626
Did you see him?

719
01:09:43,698 --> 01:09:46,861
Anyway, it's your fault.
You stopped here.

720
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:50,702
Your grandfather
was really a wonderful man.

721
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:54,400
Ah, yes, that's right.
Why did you say that?

722
01:09:54,475 --> 01:09:57,000
You're always saying that your
grandfather was a wonderful man.

723
01:09:57,078 --> 01:09:59,706
Yeah, that's right,
he was a wonderful man.

724
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:05,115
- What are you doing?
- I'm closing the shutters.

725
01:10:05,186 --> 01:10:06,915
You're crazy.
It's only four o'clock.

726
01:10:06,988 --> 01:10:08,717
I know it's four o'clock.

727
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,950
Do you have anything
against love in the afternoon?

728
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:13,118
- Against what?
- Against love in the afternoon.

729
01:10:13,194 --> 01:10:14,855
Well, no, but--

730
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:32,271
Listen to this one.
''Farmer, man of few words...

731
01:10:32,346 --> 01:10:36,783
seeks to wed Roman Catholic,
even if physically handicapped.

732
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:39,615
Will answer all.''
Ah, well.

733
01:10:39,687 --> 01:10:41,314
You shouldn't make fun of them.

734
01:10:41,389 --> 01:10:43,880
Obviously, I have my reasons
for feeling this way...

735
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,449
but I think that people
who use these classified ads...

736
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,825
are idealists.

737
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:51,922
In five lines they try
to transform their lives...

738
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:53,933
and on those five lines...

739
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:56,333
they spend hours
writing and rewriting.

740
01:10:56,404 --> 01:11:00,135
They try to put everything
in a few words--

741
01:11:00,207 --> 01:11:04,439
their hopes and their dreams...

742
01:11:04,512 --> 01:11:07,777
their ideas about what
life should be.

743
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:12,249
You know,
I never told you this.

744
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,551
Julie Roussel's letters
were very beautiful.

745
01:11:15,623 --> 01:11:19,582
Beautiful because they were
so full of hope.

746
01:11:21,295 --> 01:11:23,763
In that correspondence
between us...

747
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:28,325
we were trying to create
something permanent...

748
01:11:28,402 --> 01:11:30,370
but you came instead...

749
01:11:31,605 --> 01:11:33,937
and brought the ephemeral.

750
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:39,505
Before I met you,
I thought life was so simple...

751
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,878
but now, I realize
it's not simple.

752
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,878
You mixed everything up.

753
01:11:45,953 --> 01:11:47,853
In a way, it's too bad.

754
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:06,335
No, I can't.

755
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:08,307
Really?

756
01:12:08,376 --> 01:12:10,241
No, please.

757
01:12:11,512 --> 01:12:13,446
I've got to tell you something.

758
01:12:15,182 --> 01:12:18,379
We can't make love for the
time being. At least, I can't.

759
01:12:18,452 --> 01:12:20,920
Even the idea
is unbearable to me.

760
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:27,359
You asked me what was wrong.
That's what it was.

761
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:34,291
It's been agony for me
when it was time to go to bed.

762
01:12:34,368 --> 01:12:36,529
So, I just had to tell you.

763
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,708
I can't tell you what it is
because I don't know myself.

764
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:47,778
I've been through times
like this before.

765
01:12:47,848 --> 01:12:51,477
And I assure you
it isn't any simpler for me.

766
01:12:51,552 --> 01:12:54,043
Maybe it won't last much longer.

767
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:57,856
You must be patient.

768
01:12:59,226 --> 01:13:01,490
Can you?

769
01:13:01,562 --> 01:13:03,723
Yes.

770
01:13:03,798 --> 01:13:06,028
But I want to be close to you.

771
01:13:15,576 --> 01:13:17,840
If I ask you some questions,
will you answer them?

772
01:13:17,912 --> 01:13:19,379
Yes.

773
01:13:19,447 --> 01:13:21,176
Were you in love with many guys?

774
01:13:21,248 --> 01:13:23,876
- Yes.
- How did things end?

775
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:28,047
Sometimes I would leave,
other times, they would.

776
01:13:29,623 --> 01:13:32,786
- Do you have any children?
- No, but--

777
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,919
- You almost did?
- Yes.

778
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:38,362
But I didn't want any, so--

779
01:13:38,432 --> 01:13:40,059
Several times?

780
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:42,401
Yes.

781
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,233
Was it sad?

782
01:13:44,305 --> 01:13:46,136
Sad and awful.

783
01:13:46,207 --> 01:13:48,903
Things don't always turn out well.

784
01:13:48,976 --> 01:13:51,740
And sometimes I told myself
I'd never make love again--

785
01:13:51,812 --> 01:13:54,906
that I'd never let anyone touch me.

786
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,540
And then I'd forget...

787
01:13:57,618 --> 01:13:58,949
fortunately!

788
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:05,416
Ask me some other questions.

789
01:14:05,493 --> 01:14:06,824
No.

790
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:13,431
You're more serious than I am,
but you haven't suffered...

791
01:14:13,501 --> 01:14:15,435
not like I have.

792
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:18,336
- Were you in love with any girls?
- Only one.

793
01:14:18,405 --> 01:14:19,804
Only one?

794
01:14:19,874 --> 01:14:22,604
It must have been important, then.
How old was she?

795
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:24,667
Twenty-three. I was twenty-six.

796
01:14:24,745 --> 01:14:26,269
Why didn't it work out?

797
01:14:26,347 --> 01:14:29,316
You must have wanted to marry her.
She didn't want to?

798
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:32,477
No. Let's talk about something else.
She's dead.

799
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:38,191
It's why after that
I couldn't date any girls.

800
01:14:38,259 --> 01:14:42,127
So I got this idea
to look for a woman by correspondence.

801
01:14:42,196 --> 01:14:45,791
The girl that you loved-- I can easily
imagine that she was better than I.

802
01:14:45,866 --> 01:14:47,094
No, she was far more--

803
01:14:47,168 --> 01:14:48,760
We were going to talk about
something else.

804
01:14:48,836 --> 01:14:50,804
Come on. Don't be sad.

805
01:14:52,006 --> 01:14:54,975
Tomorrow we must go pick up
your dress from the seamstress.

806
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:57,340
No, I don't want that dress anymore.

807
01:14:57,411 --> 01:14:59,436
Oh, don't be like that.
You did want it.

808
01:14:59,513 --> 01:15:01,140
And anyway, it's ready.
We're going.

809
01:15:02,283 --> 01:15:05,446
No. I was dressing for you--

810
01:15:05,519 --> 01:15:10,286
to please you
so you'd want me all the time.

811
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:13,485
And then now, right now--

812
01:15:13,561 --> 01:15:17,019
But I told you it doesn't matter.
What I want for you is to be pretty--

813
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:19,327
even prettier.

814
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,062
Yes, I know you don't like it
when I tell you that you're beautiful.

815
01:15:22,136 --> 01:15:24,798
You think I'm exaggerating.

816
01:15:24,872 --> 01:15:25,668
Wait.

817
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,373
I'll explain. Wait.

818
01:15:30,377 --> 01:15:32,311
I'm waiting.

819
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:35,041
I won't talk about your beauty anymore.

820
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:38,676
I'll even tell you you're ugly,
if you want.

821
01:15:38,752 --> 01:15:42,415
I'll try to describe you
as if you were a photograph...

822
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:43,820
or a painting.

823
01:15:43,891 --> 01:15:45,381
Be quiet.

824
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:48,424
Your face--

825
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:52,329
Your face is a landscape.

826
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,027
You see? I'm neutral
and impartial.

827
01:15:56,637 --> 01:15:58,400
There are two eyes...

828
01:15:58,472 --> 01:16:00,940
two small, brown lakes.

829
01:16:01,008 --> 01:16:03,203
Brown-green.

830
01:16:03,277 --> 01:16:06,440
Two small brownish-green lakes.

831
01:16:06,513 --> 01:16:10,506
Your forehead is a plain.

832
01:16:11,619 --> 01:16:13,211
Your nose--

833
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:16,620
a very little mountain.

834
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:20,888
Your mouth-- a volcano.

835
01:16:20,961 --> 01:16:23,191
Open it a little.
I love to see your teeth.

836
01:16:23,264 --> 01:16:24,891
No, no. Not too much.

837
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:28,597
There. Like that.

838
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:30,694
You know what comes out of your mouth
when you're bad?

839
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:31,897
Toads.

840
01:16:31,972 --> 01:16:33,940
Yes, yes. Toads.

841
01:16:34,008 --> 01:16:36,238
And pearl necklaces,
when you're nice.

842
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:40,104
Wait.

843
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,772
I am waiting.

844
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,580
Let's talk a bit
about your smile now.

845
01:16:45,653 --> 01:16:48,713
No, not that one.

846
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:51,917
That's the one you make on the street
at shopkeepers.

847
01:16:51,992 --> 01:16:54,222
No. Give me the other one,
the real one.

848
01:16:54,295 --> 01:16:57,264
The happy one.
There you go.

849
01:16:57,331 --> 01:16:59,162
That's it. Great!

850
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:03,167
No, that's too much.
It hurts my eyes.

851
01:17:03,237 --> 01:17:05,262
I don't want to look at you anymore.

852
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:06,328
Wait.

853
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:08,773
I am waiting.

854
01:17:08,842 --> 01:17:11,276
My eyes are closed,
but I still see you.

855
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:14,010
I'm visualizing.

856
01:17:15,683 --> 01:17:19,779
If I were blind, I would while my time
caressing your face.

857
01:17:19,853 --> 01:17:21,081
Your body too.

858
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:25,521
And if I were deaf...

859
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:28,652
I would learn to read your lips
with my fingers...

860
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:30,663
like that.

861
01:17:41,608 --> 01:17:43,633
Even if it all has to end badly...

862
01:17:43,711 --> 01:17:46,612
I am delighted
to have known you, Madame.

863
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:11,537
Where are you going?

864
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,300
I'm not going
the same way you are.

865
01:18:13,374 --> 01:18:14,966
You mean you're not coming
to the fitting?

866
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:16,373
I'm going to the movies.

867
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:18,035
You're going
to the movies alone?

868
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:20,637
- What are you going to see?
- Arizona Jim.

869
01:18:20,714 --> 01:18:23,376
Well, in that case, I'll see
you at home. I'll take a cab.

870
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:24,747
Okay.

871
01:18:24,818 --> 01:18:26,843
Louis, try to be good, huh?

872
01:18:41,235 --> 01:18:42,862
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

873
01:18:44,438 --> 01:18:47,430
- Monsieur Mahé. How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

874
01:18:47,508 --> 01:18:52,036
But don't you remember me?
Comolli, the private detective.

875
01:18:52,112 --> 01:18:53,739
Yes, yes, of course.

876
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:58,183
Good. I had the impression that
you didn't really recognize me.

877
01:18:58,252 --> 01:19:01,688
It's true,
it was 12,000 kilometers away.

878
01:19:01,755 --> 01:19:03,814
Which way are you going?
This way or that way?

879
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:06,951
- Nowhere in particular.
- Oh, fine.

880
01:19:07,027 --> 01:19:10,121
Then we could spend
a few minutes together maybe.

881
01:19:10,197 --> 01:19:12,131
Shall we sit down?

882
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:15,460
I wanted to talk to you...

883
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:18,437
to bring you up to date
on my investigation.

884
01:19:18,505 --> 01:19:21,201
By the way,
what are you doing here?

885
01:19:21,275 --> 01:19:23,106
I'm on vacation.

886
01:19:24,478 --> 01:19:27,106
That's quite a coincidence.

887
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:32,380
Because I'm here working on the
investigation you hired me for.

888
01:19:32,453 --> 01:19:34,546
I'm even wondering
if your wife--

889
01:19:34,621 --> 01:19:36,885
I'm afraid
I must call her your wife--

890
01:19:36,957 --> 01:19:38,891
I'm wondering
if she's not in the vicinity.

891
01:19:38,959 --> 01:19:41,553
I'm on the trail of a blonde
who was working as a hostess...

892
01:19:41,628 --> 01:19:45,325
in a nightclub in the Antibes
and then...

893
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:47,230
she disappeared.

894
01:19:48,936 --> 01:19:53,805
I only know your wife from the
picture you gave me in Reunion.

895
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:55,808
In terms of
a police identification...

896
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:58,845
she has no
distinguishing marks at all.

897
01:19:58,912 --> 01:20:03,144
Surprisingly,
whenever I describe her...

898
01:20:03,217 --> 01:20:05,742
the symmetry of her features...

899
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:09,550
the transparency of her skin
and her hair.

900
01:20:09,623 --> 01:20:12,456
People who've met her
always remember her.

901
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:16,893
Gentlemen really
do prefer blondes.

902
01:20:18,499 --> 01:20:22,299
In any case,
she doesn't pass unnoticed.

903
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:25,736
Since you got here, you haven't
heard anything about her?

904
01:20:25,806 --> 01:20:28,001
I've been cured of blondes.

905
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:31,738
Sometimes one has a relapse,
you know.

906
01:20:31,812 --> 01:20:34,178
How about
having dinner together?

907
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:36,307
Which hotel are you staying at?

908
01:20:36,383 --> 01:20:37,680
Hotel?

909
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:41,118
Aren't you in a hotel?
Are you staying with friends?

910
01:20:42,356 --> 01:20:45,348
- Would you like something?
- A beer.

911
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:46,892
Waiter.

912
01:20:48,262 --> 01:20:50,196
Two beers.

913
01:20:50,264 --> 01:20:51,822
Excuse me.

914
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:52,589
Hurry up, Marion.
We've got to get out of here.

915
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:54,684
We've got to leave this place.

916
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:57,127
It's me, Monsieur Mahé.

917
01:21:57,197 --> 01:21:58,721
Comolli.

918
01:21:58,799 --> 01:22:01,666
Were you expecting someone else?

919
01:22:01,735 --> 01:22:04,363
No, no. I thought it was
the maid, that's all.

920
01:22:04,438 --> 01:22:06,929
And these dresses, these shoes,
these stockings...

921
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:09,100
do they belong to your maid?

922
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:14,111
Monsieur Comolli, I don't want
you to look for my wife anymore.

923
01:22:14,181 --> 01:22:17,241
You can drop your investigation.
Just tell me how much I owe you.

924
01:22:17,317 --> 01:22:21,151
I see. You certainly have
the right to change your mind.

925
01:22:21,221 --> 01:22:24,418
But I'd like to remind you
of one thing.

926
01:22:24,491 --> 01:22:26,516
You aren't my only client
in this affair.

927
01:22:26,593 --> 01:22:28,561
There is also
Madame Berthe Roussel, remember?

928
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:31,792
She's paid half the fee and it
wouldn't be fair at all to her.

929
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:36,529
I'll take care of Berthe Roussel.
I'll write to her.

930
01:22:36,603 --> 01:22:40,596
No, no, Monsieur Mahé.
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

931
01:22:40,674 --> 01:22:43,108
You've picked the only detective
who's incapable...

932
01:22:43,176 --> 01:22:46,839
of dropping an investigation
once he's started it.

933
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:52,647
- Excuse me, I have things to do.
- Then I'll walk along with you.

934
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,243
Behind you, if you prefer.

935
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:56,448
No, look, Monsieur Comolli,
I'm not getting through to you.

936
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:58,150
Let's forget about fees.

937
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:00,625
I'll pay what you want,
as much as you like.

938
01:23:00,694 --> 01:23:02,753
Just name a figure.

939
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:04,694
Only leave us alone.

940
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:07,495
I don't want any money.

941
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:10,229
I must arrest the person
who lives here with you.

942
01:23:10,303 --> 01:23:11,736
It no longer concerns you.

943
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,438
It's in the hands of the police.

944
01:23:15,509 --> 01:23:18,069
The body of the real
Julie Roussel...

945
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:21,273
was found
in the port of Djibouti.

946
01:23:21,348 --> 01:23:23,748
If your wife wasn't
directly responsible...

947
01:23:23,817 --> 01:23:26,684
she was an accomplice
in this murder.

948
01:23:28,055 --> 01:23:30,023
I'm not leaving here
without her.

949
01:23:31,692 --> 01:23:33,023
You're wrong, Monsieur Comolli.

950
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:35,891
My wife is not leaving
this house, and neither are you.

951
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:05,024
What are you doing there?

952
01:24:05,092 --> 01:24:08,994
I thought you hadn't come home yet.
I didn't see any lights.

953
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:11,656
You're mad because I'm late.

954
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:15,896
Here, I got you the plain cotton
socks that you like so much.

955
01:24:15,969 --> 01:24:17,561
Look.

956
01:24:22,509 --> 01:24:24,238
What happened? Who is it?

957
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:26,575
Comolli, the private detective.

958
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:29,778
- Did you do it?
- Yes.

959
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:33,786
He'd traced you here. He wanted
to turn you over to the police.

960
01:24:35,789 --> 01:24:37,848
That makes one less bastard.

961
01:24:40,861 --> 01:24:42,886
What are we going to do?

962
01:24:42,963 --> 01:24:46,330
To begin with,
let's have something to drink.

963
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:48,333
I'll go and get it.

964
01:24:55,509 --> 01:24:57,670
- We must leave.
- Yes, that's right.

965
01:24:57,744 --> 01:25:01,874
But not right away. We've got to
cover up our tracks carefully.

966
01:25:07,554 --> 01:25:10,182
First we've got to bury him.

967
01:25:10,257 --> 01:25:12,191
In the garden?

968
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:15,961
No, the cellar.

969
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:19,487
There is one,
but I've never been down there.

970
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:23,593
I'll have to go see
what kind of a floor it is...

971
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,831
whether it's cement
or just a dirt floor.

972
01:26:18,992 --> 01:26:22,359
Are you going to bed like that?

973
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:24,556
Why do you talk to me like that?

974
01:26:24,631 --> 01:26:26,565
What do you mean?

975
01:26:26,633 --> 01:26:28,567
Come here.

976
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,632
Come.

977
01:26:40,814 --> 01:26:42,748
Come here.

978
01:26:53,226 --> 01:26:56,161
No, no, not like this.

979
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:01,792
Yes, yes, yes.

980
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,234
Are you hungry too?

981
01:27:49,215 --> 01:27:51,149
I'll peel you an orange.

982
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:59,183
Our only problem is to find out
if that idiot cop--

983
01:27:59,259 --> 01:28:01,193
Comolli was not a cop.
He was a private detective.

984
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:03,923
Anyway, we've got to find out
if anyone else knew...

985
01:28:03,997 --> 01:28:06,261
about the investigation,
especially here in France.

986
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:10,133
Maybe he told someone he'd
traced us to Aix-en-Provence.

987
01:28:10,203 --> 01:28:12,398
Maybe he's the kind of man who
tells everything to his wife.

988
01:28:12,472 --> 01:28:13,962
He wasn't a married man.

989
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,201
He was the kind of person
who kept to himself.

990
01:28:16,276 --> 01:28:17,834
All wrapped up in his work.

991
01:28:17,911 --> 01:28:21,540
Let's hope nobody will notice his
disappearance for a long time to come.

992
01:28:21,614 --> 01:28:23,548
And by then
we'll be settled in Paris.

993
01:28:23,616 --> 01:28:27,450
I've already told you to forget that.
We mustn't go to Paris.

994
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,648
I think we'd better go
to some city like Lyon.

995
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:33,090
I don't understand.
Why Lyon and not Paris?

996
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:37,152
Because that's what I think is
best. Don't bother me anymore!

997
01:28:43,603 --> 01:28:46,970
You were nicer to me
when you called me Julie.

998
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,632
Was I?

999
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:51,574
You think so?

1000
01:29:57,210 --> 01:30:00,941
- What are you thinking about?
- About you.

1001
01:30:01,014 --> 01:30:02,914
Yes, but what about me?

1002
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:05,610
I'm worried. You've been
spending an awful lot of money.

1003
01:30:05,685 --> 01:30:09,553
- Here we go again.
- Yep.

1004
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:14,448
I don't understand it.
It just slips through my fingers.

1005
01:30:14,527 --> 01:30:18,088
I heard they are starting
a cigarette factory near Grenoble.

1006
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:20,291
I think I'll go and see
if I can get a job.

1007
01:30:20,366 --> 01:30:23,301
Work! I don't believe in it.

1008
01:30:23,369 --> 01:30:26,167
And besides,
I hate men who work.

1009
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:29,265
Doesn't Jardine
send you money anymore?

1010
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:33,301
He used to send the money orders
to General Delivery, Marseilles.

1011
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:36,712
I could write him and tell him
that I'm in Lyon.

1012
01:30:36,783 --> 01:30:38,978
But that wouldn't be very safe.

1013
01:30:39,052 --> 01:30:40,849
To cash money orders,
you have to be known...

1014
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,979
you have to show identification.

1015
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:47,882
It's risky, isn't it?
What do you think about it?

1016
01:30:51,598 --> 01:30:55,261
Here we go. You're sulking.
I knew it.

1017
01:30:56,202 --> 01:31:00,104
Now you're just pretending to be mad
because inside you're not really mad.

1018
01:31:00,173 --> 01:31:02,505
You put on that cold look...

1019
01:31:02,575 --> 01:31:04,566
but inside you're smiling.

1020
01:31:04,644 --> 01:31:06,874
Come on.
Show me your smile.

1021
01:31:06,946 --> 01:31:09,346
I'm fed up with all that smile crap!
It doesn't work anymore!

1022
01:31:09,415 --> 01:31:12,282
Don't speak to me.
For Christ's sake, leave me alone!

1023
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,455
All right. Okay.
That's fine with me.

1024
01:31:17,924 --> 01:31:20,950
It's not difficult to know
what you're thinking of me.

1025
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:24,427
And you're asking yourself...

1026
01:31:24,497 --> 01:31:26,590
''Why the hell am I
with this guy who's broke...

1027
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:31,501
and can't even knock over an old lady
in the street to steal her purse?''

1028
01:31:31,571 --> 01:31:33,505
You only think of yourself.

1029
01:31:33,573 --> 01:31:36,167
You're not a selfish girl.

1030
01:31:36,242 --> 01:31:38,039
You're selfishness personified.

1031
01:31:38,111 --> 01:31:40,477
You think that you're a real person,
that you're unique.

1032
01:31:40,547 --> 01:31:42,276
But you're not.

1033
01:31:42,348 --> 01:31:45,181
You're just one in
a growing multitude of girls now--

1034
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:48,618
not really bitches,
not really adventuresses or whores, no--

1035
01:31:48,688 --> 01:31:51,316
But some kind of parasite...

1036
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:53,791
who live outside normal society.

1037
01:31:55,762 --> 01:31:59,198
You're not women or girls.

1038
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:01,665
You're chicks.

1039
01:32:01,734 --> 01:32:04,601
What else you are
doesn't have an exact name.

1040
01:32:04,671 --> 01:32:08,903
Mindless, with your heads
full of garbage or air.

1041
01:32:08,975 --> 01:32:10,909
You're in love with your own bodies.

1042
01:32:10,977 --> 01:32:13,571
You're always going out in the sun,
always tanning.

1043
01:32:13,646 --> 01:32:16,843
You spend hours fixing your face.

1044
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:22,377
You can't pass by a car without looking
at your reflection in the windshield.

1045
01:32:23,623 --> 01:32:26,217
But you know where to find
most of these girls?

1046
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:28,487
In airports. Yes!

1047
01:32:28,561 --> 01:32:31,394
Everywhere planes are taking off
for faraway spots.

1048
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:35,025
Because you are beautiful girls,
and beautiful girls get fought over.

1049
01:32:35,101 --> 01:32:37,433
They're invited from
one big city to another.

1050
01:32:37,503 --> 01:32:41,030
And they go there.
They stroll around everywhere...

1051
01:32:41,107 --> 01:32:43,701
with their little purses
in hand, all made up.

1052
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,539
Now you're really mad.

1053
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,084
That makes me happy.

1054
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:56,588
Because when you're mad, your mouth
gets twisted-- it gets crooked.

1055
01:32:56,656 --> 01:33:00,922
And you turn ugly.
Really ugly.

1056
01:33:00,994 --> 01:33:02,928
So dreadfully ugly.

1057
01:33:09,702 --> 01:33:11,932
You sold the bracelet I gave you, huh?

1058
01:33:12,005 --> 01:33:15,270
Well, here are other things
to sell. Here!

1059
01:33:15,942 --> 01:33:19,275
My cuff links.

1060
01:33:19,345 --> 01:33:21,939
My watch also.
There you go!

1061
01:33:22,015 --> 01:33:23,573
Just wait. That's not all.

1062
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:25,845
I've got change.
You want the change, don't you?

1063
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,764
You were right.
It was really very good.

1064
01:34:16,836 --> 01:34:18,861
It wasn't just another Western.

1065
01:34:18,938 --> 01:34:21,998
Ah no. It was a love story,
with lots of feeling in it.

1066
01:34:22,075 --> 01:34:24,043
They're wonderful, aren't they?
Both of them.

1067
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:25,941
Great.

1068
01:34:26,012 --> 01:34:29,846
Wasn't this the street, Marion--
Julie-- where you saw that coat?

1069
01:34:29,916 --> 01:34:31,281
Yes. Somewhere around here.

1070
01:34:31,351 --> 01:34:32,784
But it doesn't matter,
I've given up that idea.

1071
01:34:32,852 --> 01:34:35,082
We can go by and take
a look anyway. Is that it?

1072
01:34:35,154 --> 01:34:37,088
Yes, it's there.

1073
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,889
No, not this window.

1074
01:34:43,529 --> 01:34:45,463
I think it's further on.

1075
01:34:45,531 --> 01:34:48,796
There. There it is.
The one with the feathers.

1076
01:34:48,868 --> 01:34:52,099
Do you like it, darling?
Do you like it?

1077
01:34:52,171 --> 01:34:54,230
Yes, it's quite a coat!

1078
01:34:54,307 --> 01:34:57,799
It's quite a coat. But actually
it's really more for Paris.

1079
01:34:57,877 --> 01:34:59,276
It may be a little far out.

1080
01:34:59,345 --> 01:35:01,813
Nothing's too far out for Paris.

1081
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:04,042
Besides, it doesn't matter.

1082
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,711
Listen, Marion.

1083
01:35:09,856 --> 01:35:12,416
I'm going to Reunion.

1084
01:35:12,492 --> 01:35:15,757
I'll be gone for five days,
or four anyway.

1085
01:35:15,828 --> 01:35:18,353
When I come back,
I'll have money.

1086
01:35:18,431 --> 01:35:20,661
I'll go see Jardine
and ask him to--

1087
01:35:20,733 --> 01:35:21,859
I'll see if he--

1088
01:35:21,934 --> 01:35:25,426
if he buys the factory from me,
my part.

1089
01:35:25,505 --> 01:35:29,703
Don't go back. They're looking
for us. You'll be arrested.

1090
01:35:29,776 --> 01:35:31,835
It doesn't matter.
I'll take my chances.

1091
01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:33,845
That's what I wanted to hear.

1092
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:03,160
It's you. You've come back.
I'm glad.

1093
01:37:03,236 --> 01:37:05,397
No, I'm just passing through.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1094
01:37:05,471 --> 01:37:07,166
- I've got to talk to you.
- Why, of course. Come on inside.

1095
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,174
No, I'd rather talk to you
out here.

1096
01:37:09,242 --> 01:37:12,541
- We can be alone in my study.
- Out here is just fine.

1097
01:37:12,612 --> 01:37:15,706
I want to know how much you
estimate the business is worth?

1098
01:37:15,781 --> 01:37:17,681
Why? Do you want to sell?

1099
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,981
That's something to look into.
We'll have to talk about it.

1100
01:37:21,053 --> 01:37:23,180
On the island there are
seven or eight men...

1101
01:37:23,256 --> 01:37:24,883
who are in a position
to buy it.

1102
01:37:24,957 --> 01:37:28,825
No, that's not what I mean.
I only want to sell it to you.

1103
01:37:28,895 --> 01:37:31,261
I want to--
I want you to buy me out.

1104
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:33,298
I'm willing to sell
at half value.

1105
01:37:33,366 --> 01:37:36,335
We've got to wind up the whole
deal by tomorrow. I need cash.

1106
01:37:36,402 --> 01:37:39,860
But this is insane. You can't
do this, for Heaven's sake.

1107
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:42,567
- Wait two or three days.
- No, listen to me. I can't.

1108
01:37:42,642 --> 01:37:45,907
As soon as I spend more than
a day somewhere, it's dangerous.

1109
01:37:45,978 --> 01:37:50,244
I'm not like other men anymore.
I've become an outcast.

1110
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:53,017
I've even committed murder.

1111
01:37:53,085 --> 01:37:55,019
You've killed her?

1112
01:37:55,087 --> 01:37:57,385
Then go and see the authorities.

1113
01:37:57,456 --> 01:38:00,357
If you explain the situation,
you'll get off.

1114
01:38:00,426 --> 01:38:02,986
Out of ten crimes of passion,
they acquit eight of them.

1115
01:38:03,062 --> 01:38:05,292
But I didn't murder her.
I killed for her.

1116
01:38:05,364 --> 01:38:08,731
To save her from the police.
You see now?

1117
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:11,599
All right, I'll do what you
want, but I think it's a shame.

1118
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:14,435
I know you must be unhappy
this way.

1119
01:38:14,507 --> 01:38:17,442
I can't say
that I'm happy with her...

1120
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:19,410
but I know that I'm unable
to live without her.

1121
01:38:19,478 --> 01:38:21,912
- If I were in your place, I'd--
- You could never be in my place.

1122
01:38:21,981 --> 01:38:24,176
This kind of thing
couldn't happen to you.

1123
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:27,378
It's not your nature,
it's mine.

1124
01:38:27,453 --> 01:38:31,549
It's happened to me, and nobody else,
and I've got to face it.

1125
01:38:31,624 --> 01:38:34,718
My dear Louis,
you're far away...

1126
01:38:34,794 --> 01:38:37,228
more than 6,000 miles...

1127
01:38:37,296 --> 01:38:40,459
and I'm taking advantage of that
to tell you that I love you.

1128
01:38:40,533 --> 01:38:43,229
''Record Your Own Voice''

1129
01:38:43,302 --> 01:38:46,271
When you're near me,
I don't dare speak to you this way.

1130
01:38:46,339 --> 01:38:50,173
You overwhelm me. It's true. Even when
you're tender, you overwhelm me.

1131
01:38:50,242 --> 01:38:53,905
So I'm afraid to tell you
silly little things.

1132
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:59,441
In Reunion, especially at first,
things were so-so between us.

1133
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:01,110
But for a while now--
I know you can feel it--

1134
01:39:01,187 --> 01:39:03,815
I can't do with you anymore.

1135
01:39:03,889 --> 01:39:08,019
Only three nights without you--
it's too much.

1136
01:39:08,094 --> 01:39:10,790
Last night I couldn't get to sleep.

1137
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:13,024
I looked for you.

1138
01:39:13,099 --> 01:39:15,465
I couldn't get to sleep
until early morning...

1139
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:18,935
and as soon as I woke up,
I thought of you.

1140
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:22,439
Even when I got dressed
I thought of you.

1141
01:39:22,508 --> 01:39:26,137
I put on my little brown blouse,
the one you like.

1142
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:28,942
Wait, wait. What was it
I still wanted to tell you?

1143
01:39:29,015 --> 01:39:32,712
I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget.
Yes, here it is.

1144
01:39:32,785 --> 01:39:35,447
I wasn't always nice to you.

1145
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:39,150
I brood, but if you notice,
it's not always about money.

1146
01:39:39,225 --> 01:39:41,785
You know, when I had
my first job...

1147
01:39:41,861 --> 01:39:44,352
my bosses were always
arguing about money.

1148
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:47,627
The manager would say:
''Watch, Marion. Watch out.

1149
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:50,032
When there's more hay in the stable,
the horses will fight.''

1150
01:39:50,102 --> 01:39:51,626
Do you understand?

1151
01:39:51,704 --> 01:39:54,639
That's why I can't stand to be poor.

1152
01:39:54,707 --> 01:39:56,470
Because poverty is mediocrity.

1153
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:58,407
And that I can't take.

1154
01:39:59,879 --> 01:40:03,042
I hope that Jardine will buy back
all the shares in the factory...

1155
01:40:03,115 --> 01:40:06,050
and then we can be happy together.

1156
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,813
I think the space on the record
is almost up.

1157
01:40:09,889 --> 01:40:13,655
I'm going to end now, and I'll have you
listen to it as soon as you get back.

1158
01:40:13,726 --> 01:40:17,162
Good-bye, Louis.
I love you.

1159
01:41:05,211 --> 01:41:07,941
- Yes?
- lt's me. Were you sleeping?

1160
01:41:08,013 --> 01:41:09,503
No, I'm still awake.

1161
01:41:09,582 --> 01:41:12,073
But I thought
you were coming tomorrow.

1162
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:14,278
l was able to get
an earlier plane.

1163
01:41:14,353 --> 01:41:17,550
- Did everything go all right?
- Yes. Everything went fine.

1164
01:41:17,623 --> 01:41:19,557
Come up quickly.

1165
01:42:34,333 --> 01:42:36,267
Are you sleeping?

1166
01:43:33,192 --> 01:43:35,752
Yes, yes, yes.

1167
01:43:57,116 --> 01:43:59,584
We can have a ball in Paris
with all this.

1168
01:43:59,652 --> 01:44:02,678
For the time being, there's
no question of going to Paris.

1169
01:44:02,755 --> 01:44:04,518
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1170
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:08,026
I'm straightening it, and
smoothing it, and arranging it.

1171
01:44:08,093 --> 01:44:10,152
You really love it, don't you?

1172
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:12,561
It's not that I love it,
but I respect it.

1173
01:44:12,631 --> 01:44:15,099
You can have whatever you want
with money.

1174
01:44:15,167 --> 01:44:17,567
You can have consideration...

1175
01:44:17,636 --> 01:44:20,434
and if you get in trouble,
you can afford a good lawyer.

1176
01:44:20,506 --> 01:44:22,906
And money can even help you
get the Legion of Honor.

1177
01:44:22,975 --> 01:44:24,909
You want
the Legion of Honor now?

1178
01:44:24,977 --> 01:44:26,706
Yes, I'm serious.

1179
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:28,747
If you're in prison and you've
got the Legion of Honor...

1180
01:44:28,814 --> 01:44:31,874
you can have your own guard
standing outside your cell.

1181
01:44:31,951 --> 01:44:33,782
Where did you hear that?

1182
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:36,787
It's true, I swear. I know.

1183
01:44:36,855 --> 01:44:38,914
Let's see how much
you're taking.

1184
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:41,858
You sure that'll be enough?
Better take some more.

1185
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:53,997
We shouldn't leave the bag out.

1186
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:11,284
Yes, that's fine.

1187
01:45:11,357 --> 01:45:13,518
Do you think
the maid looks honest?

1188
01:45:13,592 --> 01:45:15,685
You see evil everywhere.

1189
01:45:15,761 --> 01:45:18,252
I don't see evil everywhere.
It is everywhere.

1190
01:45:24,403 --> 01:45:27,304
Just look how beautiful
my coat is.

1191
01:45:27,373 --> 01:45:29,307
It gets bored all alone.
It's sad.

1192
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:31,468
I should have kept it by me.

1193
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,876
It seems to me that you're
looking at a lot of girls.

1194
01:45:36,949 --> 01:45:39,213
Me? Oh no, no, I'm not.

1195
01:45:39,284 --> 01:45:41,616
Yes, Monsieur Mahé.
You've taken to looking at women...

1196
01:45:41,687 --> 01:45:44,247
and you look at them well.

1197
01:45:44,323 --> 01:45:47,759
- Two coffees, waiter.
- And make them strong.

1198
01:45:47,826 --> 01:45:51,387
- How strong?
- As strong as your arm.

1199
01:45:51,463 --> 01:45:52,589
Really?

1200
01:45:52,664 --> 01:45:55,565
France-Soir.
Get your France-Soir.

1201
01:45:55,634 --> 01:45:58,034
Do you see what I see?

1202
01:45:58,103 --> 01:46:00,264
I'll be damned.
Here, please.

1203
01:46:03,342 --> 01:46:04,866
Thanks.

1204
01:46:04,943 --> 01:46:07,104
What does it say?

1205
01:46:07,179 --> 01:46:09,477
It took a flood last night
in Aix-en-Provence...

1206
01:46:09,548 --> 01:46:12,642
to uncover the body
of an unknown man in a cellar.

1207
01:46:12,718 --> 01:46:14,447
Continued on page five.

1208
01:46:20,592 --> 01:46:23,493
It took a flood.

1209
01:46:23,562 --> 01:46:26,554
The autopsy revealed
a bullet from a revolver...

1210
01:46:26,632 --> 01:46:28,566
in the body of the victim...

1211
01:46:28,634 --> 01:46:31,831
which would seem to justify the
theory of some criminal action.

1212
01:46:31,904 --> 01:46:34,771
The police are looking
for all the former tenants.

1213
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,535
Let's get out of here.

1214
01:46:39,945 --> 01:46:42,072
We've got to leave
as if nothing happened.

1215
01:46:42,147 --> 01:46:45,742
- Never mind those coffees. The check.
- I'm going to pick up my coat.

1216
01:46:45,818 --> 01:46:47,752
I'll leave the place first
and wait in the car.

1217
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:50,345
- Look. Be careful.
- Don't worry.

1218
01:46:59,064 --> 01:47:01,055
They're for us all right.
Let's get out of here.

1219
01:47:01,133 --> 01:47:03,226
You're out of your mind. What
about all the money up there?

1220
01:47:03,302 --> 01:47:05,770
- Forget it!
- No. I'll try to go alone.

1221
01:47:05,838 --> 01:47:07,567
They're less suspicious
of a woman.

1222
01:47:07,639 --> 01:47:11,040
No, no, listen, I have an idea.
Let's try the back.

1223
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:40,167
Marion, come back here!

1224
01:47:44,843 --> 01:47:47,403
What's the matter?

1225
01:47:47,479 --> 01:47:50,846
You can't go like that.
They'll pick you up right away.

1226
01:47:50,916 --> 01:47:53,146
Are you out of your mind?
What's wrong with this coat?

1227
01:47:53,218 --> 01:47:56,779
I know what I'm talking about.
Wait. I'll turn the car around.

1228
01:47:58,357 --> 01:48:01,292
If there's any problem,
we can get out fast.

1229
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,994
You'll make it.

1230
01:48:43,268 --> 01:48:45,634
It's for us all right. The
stairs are crawling with cops.

1231
01:48:45,704 --> 01:48:48,104
-And the money?
-You can forget about the money.

1232
01:48:48,173 --> 01:48:51,199
It's impossible to get into
our apartment. They're inside.

1233
01:48:51,276 --> 01:48:54,302
I hid in that little apartment
they're repainting.

1234
01:48:54,379 --> 01:48:56,108
I couldn't get any further.

1235
01:49:01,553 --> 01:49:03,111
Act naturally.

1236
01:49:08,227 --> 01:49:09,819
Let's get out of Lyon
and head for Switzerland.

1237
01:49:09,895 --> 01:49:11,362
And how? With no money?

1238
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,489
We're better off
without the money, and free.

1239
01:49:13,565 --> 01:49:16,125
I told you to take more!
I told you!

1240
01:49:19,238 --> 01:49:22,366
- I was sure this would happen.
- Yeah, yeah, sure. As usual.

1241
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:25,205
I'm not always sure,
but I was sure of that.

1242
01:49:26,345 --> 01:49:27,972
I told you to take more money.

1243
01:49:28,046 --> 01:49:30,105
In fact, we should never
have left that bag.

1244
01:49:30,182 --> 01:49:33,811
It's easy to say afterwards
what should've been done.

1245
01:49:37,556 --> 01:49:40,286
When Richard drove, he used
to yell at the other drivers.

1246
01:49:40,359 --> 01:49:42,452
He'd say those that passed him
were bastards...

1247
01:49:42,527 --> 01:49:45,018
and those that he passed
were suckers.

1248
01:49:45,097 --> 01:49:50,091
He would say, ''I'd rather be thought
a bastard then taken for a fool.''

1249
01:49:50,168 --> 01:49:52,636
I think that's pretty disgusting.

1250
01:49:52,704 --> 01:49:56,367
I'd prefer to be taken
for a fool than for a bastard.

1251
01:49:56,441 --> 01:49:59,933
But Richard would've never left
the money in that apartment.

1252
01:50:00,012 --> 01:50:02,037
Well, baby, you listen.

1253
01:50:02,114 --> 01:50:04,048
You know the prison
where he's locked up.

1254
01:50:04,116 --> 01:50:06,243
There's always a miserable hotel
opposite every prison.

1255
01:50:06,318 --> 01:50:10,049
Take a room on the top floor and
you can wave from your window.

1256
01:50:10,122 --> 01:50:12,215
You can bring him oranges
on Sunday and in five years...

1257
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:15,783
you'll be right there when he comes out.
Beat it. Go on.

1258
01:50:29,074 --> 01:50:31,634
Get back in the car.

1259
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:33,644
Come on.

1260
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,874
Look. Over there.

1261
01:50:42,577 --> 01:50:44,408
Do you think
anybody lives there?

1262
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:46,413
Surely not.
There would be smoke.

1263
01:50:46,481 --> 01:50:50,542
It must be a lodge for skiers
or something like that.

1264
01:50:52,053 --> 01:50:53,816
It's wonderful.

1265
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:56,220
I'd never expect
to find this here.

1266
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:59,124
It's a series that's impossible
to find anymore.

1267
01:50:59,194 --> 01:51:01,059
And besides being rare...

1268
01:51:01,129 --> 01:51:03,723
it's the first book that
my grandfather ever gave me.

1269
01:51:04,966 --> 01:51:08,129
I'll read parts of it to you
every night.

1270
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:11,104
I prefer this old cookbook.
It's more fun.

1271
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:16,169
- Did you look at the map?
- I sure did.

1272
01:51:16,244 --> 01:51:19,111
In order to get across
this border here...

1273
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,011
we should be able
to go through this forest.

1274
01:51:21,082 --> 01:51:24,540
It's almost unwatched,
especially during the weekend.

1275
01:51:24,619 --> 01:51:26,143
We can make it across
this weekend...

1276
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:29,918
and once we're on the other side,
we'll be out of trouble.

1277
01:51:29,991 --> 01:51:31,652
What about cash?

1278
01:51:31,726 --> 01:51:34,024
You're not going
to begin that again.

1279
01:51:34,095 --> 01:51:36,689
We've still got a little bit,
then we can sell the car.

1280
01:51:36,764 --> 01:51:39,255
Yes, but that's just
small change.

1281
01:51:40,468 --> 01:51:43,562
I've got an idea,
but you'll just get mad.

1282
01:51:43,638 --> 01:51:45,799
Of course I won't. Tell me.

1283
01:51:45,874 --> 01:51:49,173
Jardine made a pretty good deal
when he bought your shares.

1284
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:52,475
If you explained things,
he'd be glad to help you.

1285
01:51:52,547 --> 01:51:54,845
Oh no, the last time I went
was bad enough.

1286
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:58,477
I could never bring myself
to face him again.

1287
01:51:58,553 --> 01:52:01,886
- If I went in your place?
- You're out of your mind!

1288
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:05,486
That man hates you.

1289
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,959
What?

1290
01:52:07,028 --> 01:52:09,053
Well, it's normal.

1291
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:12,998
Put yourself in his place.
It's unimportant anyway.

1292
01:52:13,067 --> 01:52:14,932
He hates me,
your Monsieur Jardine.

1293
01:52:15,003 --> 01:52:16,470
I must say he's got some nerve.

1294
01:52:16,537 --> 01:52:19,404
I didn't look for you.
I didn't kill the detective.

1295
01:52:19,474 --> 01:52:22,238
He hates me, does he?
Well, that's pretty good.

1296
01:52:25,413 --> 01:52:27,677
Come back. Listen.

1297
01:52:27,749 --> 01:52:29,307
You listen.
We'll never make it together.

1298
01:52:29,384 --> 01:52:32,217
Give me the keys to the car
and I'll manage.

1299
01:52:39,027 --> 01:52:41,757
I am still your husband.
You won't be going anywhere.

1300
01:52:41,829 --> 01:52:45,629
- And who'll stop me, you?
- Yes.

1301
01:53:26,407 --> 01:53:29,740
A rat. I saw a rat over there,
by the door. I couldn't sleep.

1302
01:53:29,811 --> 01:53:32,905
I'll see about it
in the morning. Come to bed.

1303
01:53:50,131 --> 01:53:53,464
The man said to spread it
around every two or three days.

1304
01:53:53,534 --> 01:53:57,231
In three days I hope
we won't be here.

1305
01:53:57,305 --> 01:53:59,296
- The broth?
- Coming up.

1306
01:54:12,787 --> 01:54:14,846
Did you read
the back of the box?

1307
01:54:14,922 --> 01:54:16,787
You'd better wash your hands.

1308
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:38,474
- What time is it?
- The sun's up already.

1309
01:54:38,546 --> 01:54:42,107
I threw up last night
for the first time in my life.

1310
01:54:42,183 --> 01:54:45,016
I've been sick as a dog.

1311
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:47,213
I vomited all over.

1312
01:54:47,288 --> 01:54:48,949
Did it disgust you?

1313
01:54:49,023 --> 01:54:51,787
No, nothing disgusts me.

1314
01:54:55,997 --> 01:54:57,760
Don't you think it would be best
if a doctor came out?

1315
01:54:57,832 --> 01:55:00,357
Have a doctor come here?
It's not safe.

1316
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:02,369
I'd rather go into the village.
It's not far.

1317
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:05,031
I'll ask the pharmacist
what to do.

1318
01:55:05,106 --> 01:55:07,802
He should know.

1319
01:55:07,875 --> 01:55:10,639
Here, drink this before I go.

1320
01:55:15,316 --> 01:55:17,784
You want anything else?

1321
01:55:17,852 --> 01:55:19,911
Give me my book.

1322
01:55:25,226 --> 01:55:27,387
No, the-- the second volume.

1323
01:55:32,433 --> 01:55:34,663
I won't be long.

1324
01:56:27,755 --> 01:56:32,988
''Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs''

1325
01:58:42,189 --> 01:58:45,124
Thank you. That's him all right.
That's my husband.

1326
01:58:50,264 --> 01:58:52,755
Louis, darling,
what are you doing out here?

1327
01:58:52,833 --> 01:58:55,324
You shouldn't be out
in the cold.

1328
01:58:55,403 --> 01:58:56,563
When I didn't see you at home...

1329
01:58:56,637 --> 01:58:59,197
I knew you were doing
something foolish.

1330
01:59:00,141 --> 01:59:02,234
Come on. I'll take you home.

1331
01:59:03,878 --> 01:59:05,812
I'm the only one
who can take care of you.

1332
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,747
Yes, take me back. I'm tired.

1333
01:59:13,187 --> 01:59:16,281
Drink that, my darling.
You'll feel better.

1334
01:59:18,125 --> 01:59:20,252
You'd better fill it
all the way.

1335
01:59:20,328 --> 01:59:22,853
I know what you're up to.

1336
01:59:22,930 --> 01:59:24,955
I accept it.

1337
01:59:25,032 --> 01:59:27,626
And I am not sorry
to have known you.

1338
01:59:27,702 --> 01:59:31,160
I am not sorry to have killed
a man for you.

1339
01:59:31,238 --> 01:59:33,331
I am not sorry I love you.

1340
01:59:33,407 --> 01:59:38,709
I'm not sorry for anything, except
there's this terrible pain. It's awful.

1341
01:59:38,779 --> 01:59:42,613
It's burning inside.
So let's get it over with.

1342
01:59:42,683 --> 01:59:46,016
Quickly!
Fill it up!

1343
01:59:46,087 --> 01:59:49,750
You knew and you did
nothing about it!

1344
01:59:49,824 --> 01:59:52,452
I'm ashamed! I'm ashamed!

1345
01:59:54,362 --> 01:59:55,624
I'm ashamed!

1346
01:59:57,598 --> 02:00:01,591
No woman deserves to be loved
like this. I'm not worth it.

1347
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:05,469
But it's not too late. I'll take
care of you. You're going to live.

1348
02:00:05,539 --> 02:00:08,337
We'll go far away
from here together.

1349
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:10,969
I'm strong enough
for both of us. You'll live.

1350
02:00:11,045 --> 02:00:15,106
Do you hear me?
You're going to live!

1351
02:00:15,182 --> 02:00:17,878
Nobody can take you away
from me.

1352
02:00:26,227 --> 02:00:28,161
I love you, Louis.

1353
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:30,288
I love you.

1354
02:00:30,364 --> 02:00:34,425
Maybe you don't believe me,
but lots of incredible things are true.

1355
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:37,904
You must be strong, my love.

1356
02:00:37,972 --> 02:00:41,237
We'll go far from here,
and we'll be together...

1357
02:00:41,308 --> 02:00:43,401
if you still want me.

1358
02:00:45,146 --> 02:00:47,205
But you are all I want.

1359
02:00:47,281 --> 02:00:49,249
Only you.

1360
02:00:49,316 --> 02:00:52,615
Just as you are,
absolutely.

1361
02:00:52,686 --> 02:00:54,620
You mustn't cry, my dear.

1362
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:58,381
It's your happiness I want,
not your tears.

1363
02:01:03,164 --> 02:01:06,759
I'm learning
what love is, Louis.

1364
02:01:06,834 --> 02:01:09,394
It's painful.

1365
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:11,404
It hurts me.

1366
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:15,537
Is that what love is?

1367
02:01:15,609 --> 02:01:18,601
Is it always so painful?

1368
02:01:18,679 --> 02:01:20,909
Yes, it hurts.

1369
02:01:59,787 --> 02:02:01,755
I think it's that way.

1370
02:02:01,822 --> 02:02:03,790
No, I'm sure it's that way.

1371
02:02:08,462 --> 02:02:11,158
It was kind of nice,
that little cabin.

1372
02:02:12,233 --> 02:02:14,360
You are beautiful.

1373
02:02:14,435 --> 02:02:17,370
When I look at you, it hurts.

1374
02:02:17,438 --> 02:02:21,534
Really? Yesterday you said
it was a joy.

1375
02:02:21,609 --> 02:02:24,976
It is a joy and yet it hurts.

1376
02:02:25,045 --> 02:02:26,979
I love you.

1377
02:02:28,482 --> 02:02:30,416
I believe you, Julie.
